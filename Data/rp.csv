It gave birth to the concept of a Bernoulli trial, which formed the basis for the famous Binomial probability distribution.

From the Binomial distribution arrived the below discrete distributions to torture the students taking stats classes:

Multinomial
Hypergeometric
Negative Binomial
Geometric
and the final thorn in the side of the probability distributions, Poisson

I struggled until yesterday to make sense of the Poisson distribution and how I could relate it to the Binomial distribution.

If you are struggling with it like me, I just have the right resource to end this madness once and for all.

It requires reading the latest post on my blog (link in the comments), where I explained how we could relate Poisson distribution to the Binomial.

You could only fail to reject it!‚Äù,"‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt accept the null hypothesis. You could only fail to reject it!‚Äù

The essence of hypothesis testing lies in this statement.

When you get a p-value that exceeds the level of significance, it means your sample hasn‚Äôt provided enough evidence for you to reject the null hypothesis.

But it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean there is enough evidence to accept that null hypothesis.

I know! Our common sense tells us that failing to reject something means accepting it, but common sense doesn‚Äôt always work in the world of statistics. (Else, why would people roam with dice in their pockets!)

Sometimes when we fail to get significant results, it might be because our sample is imperfect.

Our sample might not be a truly random one, or our sample might be too small to meet the assumptions of the central limit theorem.

No wonder we get p-values exceeding the significance levels in such cases, preventing us from rejecting the null hypothesis.

Our next logical step would be seeing how this data was sampled or collecting more data to find enough evidence to embrace the null hypothesis.

But make no mistake, you have valuable information about your data by looking at the correlations between the variables.

And if you're planning to build a linear model using supervised machine learning, the presence of correlated variables will exacerbate the model's accuracy.

Hence, looking at the correlations between continuous variables is almost a non-negotiable task, and one of the ways to do it is by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for these variables.

Pearson coefficient is the default mode for many, including me, for testing correlations. 

But Pearson coefficient has found its kryptonite in the form of the non-linear relationship between the variables. 

Pearson coefficient makes sense only when there is a linear relationship between the variables and is not very useful when the variables have a non-linear relationship.

Hence it is high time we adopt other measures of correlation in addition to the Pearson coefficient to ensure we are not missing out on valuable correlations in the data.

Own a computer.
Move to a city.
Work in a corporate job.
Fly abroad.

I was fortunate enough to check off all these things from my list, but moving to the United States as an international student has expanded my view of the world.

Sometimes, it is hard to believe that I am no longer at home, and sometimes, it is hard to feel at home here.

I realize this struggle is a rule rather than an exception after looking at those walking down the same path alongside me.

And to take my story further, I have a request that might sound too familiar to the people on LinkedIn.

I am looking for internship opportunities in the data science & analytics roles for the summer 2023 term. 

Before moving to the United States, I worked for four years in India as an SAP consultant.

Hence, I am no stranger to the world of endless meetings that could have been simple emails, volatile business requirements, and tasks with unrealistic deadlines.

Also, did I mention that I am from a civil engineering background? (I might or might not have said it a few million times in my previous posts.)

Moving into a tech career from a non-tech background asked a lot of me, but I always gave my 100%, which took me on a fascinating and sometimes weird journey over four years. Three great companies: Accenture, Infosys, and Deloitte, saw my potential and took a chance on me during this period.

I decided to move it up a notch by starting a self-learning journey in data science six months ago (because data is the new oil, right?).

Meanwhile, I learned a decent amount of Python, SQL, and basic machine learning stuff (I know that logistic regression is for classification problems and that I should always separate test data from training data.)

But let me be honest and admit that this learning journey was scary and boring at times.

To keep me consistent and entertained in this journey, I started creating memes and writing funny stuff about things I learned.

The stuff I post on LinkedIn might be funny and sometimes outright dumb, but people who worked alongside me in any capacity would attest that I am a serious professional.

After reflecting on my dreams while growing up and where I am currently, I sometimes wonder if I have peaked already in my life and career.

But something in me tells me it is not the case. I set out on a new journey to find it out, and I would be more than grateful if you could help me by providing any referrals or leads for the internship opportunities.

Thank you!

The weather on that day was gloomy as clouds covered the sun.

I decided to switch on some music to beat the blues, and the British band Coldplay has always been my go-to choice during difficult times.

The below lyric from one of the Coldplay songs I listened to that day caught my attention and stayed in my mind.

""I have no doubt. One day the sun will come out!""

And this week, I flew to the United States for the first time in my life and caught a glimpse of the Oklahoma sun which made me think about this lyric again.

It is almost as if the sun never goes away here (the sun sets at nine freaking PM!)

Though the sun shines brighter and longer each day, I couldn't stop reflecting on how much the group of international students I have been part of had to go through to enter this phase.

We had to deal with emotional goodbyes, hectic flights, difficult immigration experiences, feelings of self-doubt, homesickness within a matter of few days.

The road that led us here has been tiring, but I believe this Oklahoma sun we saw signals the start of better days!

All those who seemed to be on the same path alongside me were building awesome projects and landing amazing job offers while I was struggling to figure out how to use a CTE without breaking my query!

I do know that comparison is the thief of joy. But knowing it only made me feel bad about comparing myself to others and added to my existing feelings of insecurity.

While the entire world was relishing the bright sunny days on LinkedIn, it felt like I was in a different time zone covered in darkness.

What helped me during such dark times was talking to fellow beginners who started their learning journeys and hearing the stories of professionals who once went through the same emotions.

It is no secret that humans crave social interaction and approval. Without these two necessities, we sink into the quicksand of loneliness and depression.

And it is the exact reason why finding a community where you feel like you belong can help you stay afloat in the deep waters of the data world.

I recently became a part of a 450+ member discord group organized by Data In Motion, LLC Motion, thanks to Kedeisha Bryan.

To paraphrase the words of Sonali Kumar, Data in Motion helps you bring structure to your self-learning journeys by letting you focus on the vital tools and concepts needed to kickstart your data career.

As a part of this community, you could access many valuable resources like resume reviews, live study sessions, regular SQL, Python & data visualization challenges, and many more.

I am pasting its discord group's invite in the comments. I wish many self-learners like me utilize the power of this community to aid their efforts.

I got a great deal on a domain from GoDaddy as its first-time user.

With the brightness of thousand blazing suns shining on my face, I went to my modest and free WordPress blog to try and figure out a way to connect it to that domain.

But my happiness was destined to be short-lived and transcend into disappointment. 

WordPress asked me to purchase a premium plan to integrate the domain, which costs 5X the amount I paid to GoDaddy.

I posted more than 100 times on that blog until now. I could rant heartfully on it without the fear of upsetting people because it had hardly ten followers. It was the only place I could go to find comfort in the online world. 

But I decided to walk away from that blog to appease the gods of custom domains.

I tried to build a new website from scratch and host it on platforms like GitHub pages or Netlify. But my web development skills were only matched by my swimming skills, and you could figure out the extent of these skills when I say I stepped into a swimming pool only twice in my lifetime.

So, I naturally screwed up and wasted my entire day on it!

I was about to give up entirely this morning until I learned about Blogger, Google's blogging platform.

Sun rose again in my kingdom. I went ahead and set up a new blog on it, made a few test posts, and linked it with my custom domain successfully.

Or at least, that's what I thought! 

It just dawned upon me that I couldn't view that blog on my computer. 

I was able to open it on my mobile phone and other PCs, but there is still trouble when I try to open that domain on my computer.

I tried to ping the domain in the command prompt, did a DNS flushing, and pulled out all sorts of rabbits from the hat, thanks to the detailed how-to guides online.

But there is still no luck.

While I lose my head trying to figure out what's wrong with my computer, you could try giving the four data science articles I copied from LinkedIn a read on my new blog!

That (n-1) in the denominator inside the square root must be no stranger to you.

There's a good chance you already know that a sample has n-1 degrees of freedom, which is why we use it in the denominator instead of a straightforward ""n.""

It is a no-brainer that using the .std() function to calculate the standard deviation for a NumPy array is a piece of cake for you.

But if you haven't heard about the ""ddof"" parameter in this function yet, let me caution you against using the .std() directly to calculate sample standard deviations.

This parameter accounts for the degree of freedom while calculating standard deviation, and its default value is zero.

If you aren't setting it to ""1"", you are calculating population standard deviation instead of the sample statistic.

Hence, always cross-check that you are setting the appropriate value to the ddof parameter while using the .std function.

If you have been struggling recently, please seek the support you deserve from your friends, family, and mental health professionals.

If someone you know is at their lowest point, please reach out to them. (A kind reminder to be non-judgemental and not utter the phrase think positive to offer unconditional support.)

Remember that life is a complicated juggling act.

It is because of that variable portion of the interest rate fluctuating like crazy in recent times.

The fixed portion of the interest rate depends on the things in your control, like the ranking of the university you chose, your financial situation, your credit history, the total duration you take to repay the loan, etc.

But the variable portion is not in your hands as it depends on the benchmark rates published by considering the indicators of inflation rates and market situations.

Since July 2021, most lenders have started using a forward-looking interest rate called ""CME Term SOFR"" as the benchmark rate to calculate the variable portion.

This rate comes with an additional parameter of tenure, based on which the rate value differs.

These tenures could be one among the following: one month, three months, six months, and twelve months.

Let us say a lender opted to use CME's three-month SOFR rate as the variable interest portion. 

That lender divides the financial year into four blocks of three months each. 

The variable interest rate for each of these blocks is the three-month term SOFR rate published by the CME group (an agency publishing these interest rates) for a date one or two business days before the start of that current block.

The best part is that this variable rate remains constant during this three-month tenure. 

But on the flip side, the nature of this tenure SOFR is forward-looking and proactive, which is a bad sign under certain circumstances.

Every time the inflation rate is soaring, the fed increases interest rates to make it difficult for people to borrow money. The rationale behind this move is that it reduces the demand for goods and services and decreases their prices.

CME Term SOFR doesn't need to wait until the fed hike the interest rates. Even a slight hint of inflation is enough for it to go up.

During COVID time, the fed decreased the interest rates to reduce the burden on the people and subsequently boost the economy. 

It meant between March 2020 to October 2021, CME Term SOFR rates were less than 0.1.

From January 2022, there has been a steady increase in this rate. Within eight months, it shot up to around 2.5 %.

If the student loan you took between late 2021 and early 2022 adopts this term CFR for variable rate calculation, you will find at least a 2% increase in your overall interest rate today.

If it hits you like a punch to your gut, there is more bad news for you because several experts predict that this variable rate might shoot up to 4% by the end of this year!

How to get on with my day despite that sinking feeling in my heart?

How to set my inner self when my entire outer world seems to be falling apart?

I started reading Liz Fosslien and Mollie West Duffy's new book, Big Feelings: How to be okay when things are not okay, to find answers to all the above questions.

Like several other readers of this book, I am in awe of the beautiful and simple illustrations of emotions presented throughout the various chapters. (You will recognize those pictures as the ones you already saw on social media and loved for their humourous and insightful tone.)

I found this book to be not just another addition to the vast array of positive psychology literature. 

It is an honest attempt to segregate various emotions by shining light on the subtle distinctions, which could help the reader to identify and deal with them constructively.

Here are a few of my favorite bits from the initial 50% of this book I completed reading so far:

""When harnessed effectively, anger can give us the strength we need to make things right."" - Big Feelings (p. 84). 

We are more likely to associate anger with a negative feeling we need to suppress to avoid punching someone in the face, but this book puts a new perspective forward by talking about how we could tap into the energy in the anger to gain the courage needed to stand up for ourselves.

Red Bull might not give you wings, but I am convinced that learning to channel the emotion in anger gives you a cape and makes you a superhuman with powers. (I lifted the image of this post from this book as it brilliantly illustrates my point.)

‚ÄúSometimes life taps you on the shoulder with a feather, sometimes hits you with a brick, and sometimes runs you over with a bus. Learn to listen when it‚Äôs just a feather.‚Äù - Big Feelings (p. 91).

Naveed Ahmad (Co-founder & CEO of Flourish) quoted it while talking about the signs of burnout in this book.

Burnout has become a ubiquitous emotion these days. For some reason, many work cultures tend to equate burnout to feelings of dedication towards the work.

Life has a few simple ways to alarm us that we are burned out (like constant tiredness or insomnia), but if we continue to ignore them, it would not be long before a bolt of lightning strikes at once with no warning signs of thunder!

I am trying to complete reading the next 50 percent of this book by the end of the week. 

Meanwhile, I highly recommend that you get your hands on it if you are looking for a book to help you understand and deal with your emotions.

And it is a wrap to my reading of a book that stayed true to its title until the very end, a book that only asked its reader to use the power of tiny improvements to build consistent habits.

You probably read the summary of Atomic Habits and its four rules a billion times on the internet. So I would not go into that.

But one of my favorite parts, which is often overlooked, and lies in the shadows of the brilliant four rules, is in the penultimate chapters.

If you are familiar with a new worldwide changing view that passion is overrated, and if you agree with it, this will appeal to you üëáüèª

""The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.""

- Atomic Habits, Chapter 19.

Passion is a marketing gimmick to promote the flourishing of an era filled with devices that offer novelty consistently.

Boredom is one of the innate truths of life, and any path to self-mastery should ideally begin with learning its importance.

It is crazy how learning to embrace boredom can impact various aspects of your life ranging from your career to relationships.

I felt Atomic Habits became complete by touching upon this topic, and it would be within my top ten must-read book recommendations for anyone willing to form a reading habit.

I don't know about you, but I certainly do, and here's why it might be unproductive üëáüèª

Thanks to Pavlov's dog experiment, we know that our brain associates a cue with a specific action if both repeatedly occur in tandem.

If you are sitting at the same place and doing the same actions every day,¬†each of these actions competes to become associated with the cue of entering that place.

When we group actions that require varying efforts with a specific cue (like location in this case), the easy ones take away the prize of being wired with that cue in our brains.

Actions like sleeping or eating require less effort in general compared to the tasks of focusing on work or reading. 

Hence, it is a no-brainer that your brain would let you nap or grab a bite over working on a portfolio project that would increase your job prospects while sitting on the couch.

Author James Clear suggests in his book 'Atomic habits' a simple action one could always follow to avoid being stuck in such a situation.

You could divide your space into various parts and assign individual tasks to each of them. (For example, nap only on the bed, eat only on the dining table, work only at your desk, etc.)

Over the next few days, try to religiously follow your plan of action by restricting each location only to the use of the tasks you initially assigned.

It takes time for the brain to become wired as per your design, but once it happens, you will find your efficiency improved in all those actions.

And you would finally stop checking the work emails while eating lunch (it is the dream, isn't it?)

I have heard about the benefits of doing one action at a time a million times in my life until now, but Atomic Habits is probably the first source that adds a spatial dimension to it and talks about doing one action at a location!

What other measures did you implement successfully to improve your efficiency while working or studying?

Yes, you would!
¬†
Author James Clear has provided not one but two such gems in the book Atomic Habits, which I will describe below üëáüèª

The implementation intention:

Instead of saying, ""I will exercise more from tomorrow,"" say, ""I will lift weights at 7:00 AM tomorrow in my local gym.""

This strategy involves setting the time and place of implementation to support your intention.

But if you are someone like me who is quite forgetful at times, you could follow the next strategy.

Habit stacking:

""I will lift weights after drinking my morning coffee tomorrow.""

It involves stacking a new habit onto an already formed one. 

The intentions we set without following these strategies are usually too vague.

The energy we would need to act upon such vague intentions is more than the energy we would require to convince ourselves to procrastinate. 

As fundamental human behavior goes, we always prefer to do actions that conserve our energy.

Hence, the simple act of eradicating vagueness improves our odds of sticking to our intentions and routines.

And it leads to the formation of concrete habits in the long run!

Author James Clear puts these words nicely in Atomic Habits to explain how our attentional capacities are limited.

While he used it primarily to make a point regarding how habit formation can ease the load on our conscious mind, it made me think about the importance of paying selective attention.

We live in a world where devices can pay better attention than humans. 

Think about Alexa, Siri, and all those creepy product advertisements that seem to pop out of nowhere after you've talked about them.

If this trend continues, it won't be long before Alexa starts setting your to-do list and shouts out commands to you.

We need to do something about it, and I believe taking a step towards gaining control over our online lives is a good start.

To achieve it, we should master the skill of paying selective attention.

It helps you swim in the ocean of clickbait without drowning.

By the way, what are some of your favorite strategies for filtering the information you consume online?

The fans of James Clear's famous book, Atomic habits, would instantly recognize this quote.

And I admit that this single quote was enough for me to jump on the bandwagon.

I started reading Atomic habits, a book that has been on my wish list for longer than the time Rose waited for Jack in Titanic. (I did not mean it literally.)

For someone that reads a large number of self-improvement books, I expected to find a lot of cliched wisdom scattered across the pages of this book.

But I am pleasantly surprised to find pearls of wisdom organized succinctly throughout the initial two chapters.

Here are a few of my favorite bits:

The graph in the image talks about the non-linear relationship between the results and the sustained efforts over time.

Many of us naively expect proportionate results when we put in the effort each time, but more often, the results we see in the initial phases are underwhelmingly low. 

It pushes us to fall into a valley of disappointment (I love how the author describes it geometrically as the distance between linear and non-linear curves) which becomes the precursor to halting the efforts.

Learning how to navigate through this valley of disappointment without giving up is the first step one could take toward building consistent habits in life.

Here's the next ideal step you might want to take üëáüèª

Greet your new connections via direct messaging and thank them for connecting with you. ü§ùüèª

But if you are on a tight schedule üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, it might not always be feasible to greet each person individually. 

Moreover, there will be days when your posts perform incredibly well, resulting in an unusually high number of new connections on LinkedIn in a single day. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The most logical step you take on such days is to skip the part of sending introductory messages altogether.

But you are losing a chance of making a great first impression with your new connections ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, who might one day help you find a new job or set up your own business.

What if I tell you that there's a way for you around this problem? üí° 

It involves as little effort as copy-pasting two strings in a Jupyter notebook and running all its cells with a single click. üéØ

(If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, it is an easy-to-use and interactive web platform for running Python code.)

naas.ai provides a notebook template that you could use for automating the task of sending introductory messages to all new connections of any current day üìÖ

The best part is you'll need to know little to no coding for using that template. ‚úÖ

You could try it out for free by following the below steps üëáüèª

1. Go to the link of the notebook I pasted in the comment.

2. Click on the green ""Open in Naas"" text. It will direct you to a login page.

3. Set up your credentials and log in to Naas. (It is free - you have 100 free credits you could use every month.)

4. Start the server, and you will find the notebook open in the Naas environment.

5. Go to the ""Get your cookies"" section and click on the 'How to get your cookies?' hyperlink. It will route you to a document that describes the process of getting your LinkedIn cookies in detail.

6. Replace the variables in that section with actual cookies data, go to the 'Run' menu at the top, and select 'Run all.' 

I might have made it sound more complicated üòÖ, but it is simple once you start doing it. Give it a try, and reach out to me if you need help at any stage! ü§ó

This one sentence is enough to explain the predicaments caused by the proliferation of information in our modern world.

This principle applies to several aspects like our diets, books we read, movies we watch, news we consume, etc.

The data models we build and analyze are no exceptions to this principle.

So, operating with this principle in our minds can serve us well in all walks of life!

And fast forward to today ‚ö°‚è©

I am still naive, but I found a few clues that set me on a data career scavenger hunt.

Most of these clues were generated by:

1. Interacting with the content of established data professionals on   this platform.
2. Posting content regularly
3. Making blunders in my posts and getting schooled by experts here.

But there's always a regret in me that I could have made a bit more progress had I known what I was getting into during the initial phases of my journey.

Michael Dillon's book, 'How to find a job in Data Analytics?' could have helped me with that. It is filled with clues to help a complete beginner make sense of the data world.

I picked its ebook this week to read and completed a significant portion of it until now.

It's not a hand-holding guide until you find a job in data analytics.

But it helps you plan your baby steps in the data world or, for that matter, decide if a data career is for you.

You won't find it every day where 46 data professionals are sitting at a single table to discuss their career journeys, but Michael managed to capture its essence in his ebook of 137 pages.

So, give it a try by purchasing your copy today (the link is in the comments).

üîµ  It is about what YOU want your audience to know about you.

üí° Back story :
‚§µ In an analysis done by Boston Consulting Group.
‚§µ f women & men participated equally as entrepreneurs
‚ñ∂ The global economy can be boosted from $2.5 T to $5 T.

‚úî Women-owned entities in the formal sector already represent approximately 37% of enterprises globally.

‚≠ï Despite the unfavourable fundraising circumstances.
üìà This number is increasing every year.

As currently what is offered by workplaces & societies are.

‚≠ï Guilt.
‚≠ï Pay parity.
‚≠ï Frustration.
‚≠ï Motherhood penalty.
‚≠ï Unrealistic Expectations.

‚§µ And there seems no end to it.
‚§µ So it's more like taking the reins into your own hands 
üîú Without waiting for the system change to its mind to become more human.

‚ñ∂ Entrepreneurs generally solve problems that they encounter 

Which means

‚úÖ More innovation in places no one was looking.
‚úÖ Access to newer untapped markets.
‚úÖ Disruption.

üîµPatterns that are emerging:

From 2007 to 2018, women-owned businesses grew by 58% in terms of the number of firms and 46% in terms of revenue.

You can ride the wave or totally ignore it but it‚Äôs happening.

And I see everyone doing the same mistake of starting by analysing 100+ most successful decks to replicate them.

What's wrong with that? 

‚ùå You want to include everything best of all the decks.

‚ùå It creates a never-ending loop of endless data & info collection.

‚ùå Pitch decks you find on the internet are mostly old enough to be shared publicly.

‚ùå The pitch narratives you enjoy the most are an outcome of an elaborate process you don‚Äôt know.

‚úÖ You may seek help to guide you to save time. 

But your story will always remain yours and will be unique.

üí° A little back story: 

-> Climate tech was once cleantech. 

-> VCs invested 25 billion in cleantech & lost half of it. 

Reasons:

‚≠ï Undefined markets & technology. 

‚≠ï Hard tech like solar panels & batteries require a lot of capital. 

‚≠ï  Needs consistent funding before becoming profitable. (Also called the valley of death)


Things only started to change after 


‚ôª Paris Agreement in 2015 when governments started allocating funds & Promoting climate tech"" for their sustainability goals.
 

So, what is driving funds in climate tech now? 


‚úÖ Demand for low-carbon products among businesses, consumers, and governments.


‚úÖ 43 climate-tech startups are now unicorns, the winner being TESLA with a 1 trillion valuation. 


‚úÖ  We all still need the earth to live more than money & profits while climate change is becoming more and more evident and visible.

‚úÖ Start by flaunting -> you have earned it.

1. Increasing demand curve.
2. Growing Revenue.
3. +ve unit economics.

‚úÖ Followed by customers' life -> your impact on them.

3.)Product,
4.)testimonials & stories.

üîµ How those impact founding team equity and cap tables overall.


Because once you agree to the terms and sign the documents there is no going back.


Here is a list of a few terms knowing which will come in handy during the fundraising process.

A lot of these terms & solutions were coined by YC to help founders raise capital early, easily & quickly.

This can be a tough question to answer, especially if you're an early-stage company that hasn't raised funding before.


Here are a few tips for how to respond when a VC asks about your startup's valuation:


Start from a place of understanding that it's their full-time job, they will be way better at it than you so 


----------------
1. Don't just throw out a valuation number. 
-------

A smarter way to respond to this question: 

We are letting the market price this round we‚Äôll end up putting together a deal that makes sense with the right investor. 

However, some of the others we‚Äôve spoken with have said they might approach valuation somewhere in the range of

on our next round, with some of the drivers being

-----------------
2. Share your valuation process and be realistic about your valuation.
--------

Don't be afraid to negotiate and find a number that works for both you and the VC.

--------
Focus on building a strong relationship and making a compelling case for your startup.

Getting fundamental right


Comes first,


But


You cannot ignore the fact that at every step of interaction, they are trying to understand you, your work style & thinking patterns.

Thus everything you choose to do or not do tells something about YOU. 

‚úÖ Great story ‚Üí A founder who can sell.


‚úÖ Simple words ‚Üí A founder knows how to communicate.


‚úÖ Got fundamentals right ‚Üí A founder who knows their stuff.


‚úÖ DD documents ready ‚Üí A true professional, easy to work with.


‚úÖ Branding, layout & design ‚Üí Founder values my convenience, and time | understands branding | is obsessed with this idea.


Conscious brains like fundamental 

While  

Unconscious brains set the gut feeling. 


It's good to have them both play on your side when raising capital for your business.

A lot of founders struggle with their traction slide especially if the graph doesn‚Äôt look like the ideal hockey stick graph.


But that should never be the case there are many ways to build a strong case for your business potential,


You need to be able to identify your growth metrics and put them forward together.


Here are a few ways you can nail your traction slide,

‚úÖ Product progress +
‚úÖ Customer acquisition +
‚úÖ Churn rate (if < 3%). +
‚úÖ Visible growth +
‚úÖ Predictability (Monthly Recurring Revenue) is also worth highlighting.


An investor will read this as ""Even if the numbers are small the growth rate is something we can build upon"".


That's the kind of incentive you would want to create in your traction slide.

But most of us struggle with it...

As Warren Buffett famously said:

""The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.""

How do we start?

First, we have to understand our non-negotiables.

For example, at¬†VITALIZE¬†we invest in B2B software in the Future of Work, and we say ""no"" to all the startups that aren't a fit. 

Your personal non-negotiables could include:
- The hours you work
- Set time with family
- Time for self-care
- The type of work you do

Next, we have to internalize that saying ""no"" frees us up to say ""yes.""

Of course, every ""no"" has an opportunity cost.

As an investor, this is ever-present, as we don't want to miss out on ""the next big thing.""

However, there's always another opportunity.

There are many ways of saying ""no"":

The x but y ""no""

When you want to help, but you can't fully support the request:
""I can review the proposal once you have a draft.""

You're not committing to the request itself, but instead, you're saying ""no"" by setting the terms of what you WILL do.

The deferred ""no""

When you're interested in the request at some point, but don't have the time now:
""I can't right now because of X, but if you follow up in a few months and I'm able to, let's chat then.""

The relational ""no""

When you're leveraging other relationships to say ""no"":
‚ÄúStudents are my top priority professionally, and since I teach more than 300 students per year, I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to take on additional mentoring.""

I got this one from the always-insightful¬†Adam Grant. 

The ""no"" after ""yes""

When you overcommit:
""Last year, when I said I could join your panel, I thought I'd have the availability. However, after taking a closer look at my calendar, I'm realizing I overextended myself and will not be able to make it.""

The deflection ""no""

When you think someone else will be better for the request:
""Thanks for thinking of me, but I'm not the best person for this. However, X is great at Y and might be helpful. I'm happy to make an email introduction if you're both okay with it.""

The alternative ""no""

When you still want to help, but don't have time:
""I'm flattered you want to talk to me about X, but I'm overextended at the moment. However, I wrote a few articles about X here and think they'd be helpful.""

The on-deadline ""no""

When you have a big project you need to focus on:
""I appreciate you reaching out, the opportunity sounds great, but I'm on deadline for my [book/course/fundraise] and have to pass. Thanks for thinking of me.""

The magician of silicon valley practised like crazy before every presentation and the impact it created was so huge that you are still reading about it after 32 years.


And here‚Äôs the logic to support it.

After the First few practices

Your brain starts getting comfortable with uncomfortable parts of the pitch.


After 10-20 times of practice
Your brain starts registering the sequence of the pitch in its own way.



30+
You start noticing examples and patterns around you.



40+
Here‚Äôs when things start getting wired while presenting
You suddenly start developing logic to support everything and anything you say.


The magic starts happening when.


Your subconscious brain takes over and starts acting itself, it modulates and adjusts effortlessly according to the audience while you don‚Äôt necessarily plan or do anything.


You can easily handle uncertainty.


Or pick up from wherever you left after up interruptions.



MOST EFFORTLESS & MAGICAL PRESENTATIONS ARE A RESULT OF COUNTLESS PRACTICES.


Imagine whom you could bring on board to build your dream if you could put in half this effort.

When it comes to creating effective and impactful solutions, the key is to always keep the people in mind.

Whether you're an entrepreneur, CEO, or startup founder, it's essential that you always think about how your decisions will affect those around you.

Of course, this isn't always easy.

There are a lot of factors to consider and it can be tough to please everyone.

However, if you take the time to really think about what's best for the people, you'll be able to create solutions that are truly impactful.

So next time you're facing a tough decision, remember to put the people first.

It might not be easy, but it's worth it when you see the positive difference you can make in their lives.

Funding does not determine startup success, but whom you raise from does.


Many people believe that securing funding from investors is the key to a successful startup.


Although funding is important, it's not the end-all and be-all of a successful startup.


Raising money from the right people is the key to success.


According to a recent survey by dealroom (on European startups), this is the case.


Companies that raise from top-quartile Seed investors are significantly more likely to convert to Series A and do so more quickly.


Don't just focus on raising money if you want to start a successful startup.


Your vision can become a reality if you find the right investors.

-Accessible while travelling.

-Easy to go back and forth.

-Easy to forward to other investors & junior analysts.

-Links do not always load, especially on flights (When most of the people clear their emails)

-uncomfortable to stay on a slide or go & forth they know you will have the data.

-For the same reason cannot reopen or revisit the deck again.

For sensitive information, you can always prepare data rooms.

- Increased liquidity >> decreased returns
- Longer timeframes = bigger outcomes
- The top companies should never NEED to go public

Can you answer 3 questions in your financial slide without actually saying them?


1.) Where will you be in 5 years?

2.) When will your company achieve breakeven?

3.) When will you need the next round of funding?


If you can't answer these questions, then your financial slide is probably missing something important.

Make sure you include all the key information to paint a clear and logical picture of your business.

We are working on a free excel template to help pre-seed founders with their financials.

It‚Äôs pre-product and pre-revenue, so he gets 1% of the company, pricing the round at $1m post-money.

The company grows like crazy and eventually sells for $10bn. The angel investor makes $100m right? 10,000x his investment?

Nope, he makes $0.

Possible? Yes. 

‚Äî-

The math is way oversimplified here, and I‚Äôm looking forward to being put in my place by the analysts, but this can and does happen‚Ä¶

Although it‚Äôs exciting when the startups you‚Äôve backed raise subsequent rounds at colossal valuations, it‚Äôs not unusual for angel investors to get burned. 

As institutional investors join later rounds, they generally expect preference shares, giving them special treatment if things take a turn for the worse. Angel investors, meanwhile, are stuck with ordinary shares. 

As the company raises more rounds, the preference terms get more punitive: 2x liquidity preference, 3x liquidity preference, anti-dilution clauses‚Ä¶ it can get complex. 

If everything goes to plan and the startup‚Äôs valuation rises steadily, all is well. If, however, the startup raises at a lower valuation than it did previously (a down round) the anti-dilution clauses kick in. Those with ordinary shares dilute at an accelerated rate, while those with anti-dilution clauses are protected. 

It‚Äôs even worse if the startup‚Äôs valuation crashes between a large round and a liquidity event like a sale or an IPO. 

Let‚Äôs say the startup raised $3bn at a $20bn valuation. Not impossible. But to get the deal done the founder had to give a 3x liquidity preference.

Later, things get tough. The company can‚Äôt raise its next round, so eventually the founder accepts a $10bn acquisition offer. Still a good result in most people‚Äôs eyes.

Actually it‚Äôs not. 

The $3bn investor walks away with $9bn (3x what they invested), leaving $1bn for the other shareholders. Those with 1x preference shares get their invested capital back. To get the deal done, the acquirer looks after the founder and a few of the key people.

The angels? It could be zero. 

‚Äî-

I know investors and employees whose shares ended up being worthless in situations similar to the above.

If you‚Äôre an angel and have the option to sell shares in a secondary market, even if you have to take a haircut on valuation, give it some serious thought.

Rather, the problem is what to work hard on.""

As an entrepreneur, you're used to working hard. 

You've given up a lot to get where you are today, and you're not afraid of putting in the extra effort to achieve your goals. 

But sometimes, it can be difficult to know what's worth grinding for. 

Is it that new client? Is it that big project? Is it simply getting through the day?

The answer is different for everyone, but one thing is certain: the grind is never a problem for entrepreneurs. 

So if you're feeling stuck in a rut, remember that not everything is worth grinding for. And once you find it, DELEGATE.

Why pitch decks are never about PowerPoint or keynote presentations?


The presentation which everyone sees is the outcome of a process.
It's about the PROCESS.


If you have a weak process or no process then the outcome surely is a weak one.

And pitching in itself is an art + science.

A good pitch should be able to plant the seed of an idea in the human mind while remaining strategic.

Nothing really helped me achieve the results I really wanted.

Until I figured while doing one of my projects that everything on the internet is available in bits & pieces.

This is especially true in the sustainability space, where there are often already-existing solutions to the problems you're trying to solve.


Looking at existing practices in a different corner of the world can help you save time and money, and it can also help you avoid reinventing the wheel.


So next time you're facing a sustainability challenge, take a look around and see what others are doing before you start from scratch.

Start becoming regenerative.

Being sustainable is no longer enough.

Sustainability was the answer maybe 20 or even 10 years ago.

But not today.

We‚Äôve reached a point where focusing only on not damaging the environment won‚Äôt save us.

We need to start giving back and restoring nature and its biodiversity.

The sustainable way:

- Use sustainable materials
- Minimize waste
- Reduce emissions
- Phase out fossil fuels

The regenerative way - all of the above plus:

- Restore biodiversity
- Plant trees
- Help endangered species to prolifer again
- Train people with green skills
- Embed regeneration in every organisation and institution
- Implement a circular economy
- Create regenerative companies and jobs
- Help local communities become more resilient


Regenerative > sustainable.

What else can we do to foster regeneration?

With the world increasingly focused on the climate crisis, there's more interest and investment in climate tech solutions than ever before.

If you're working on a solution to help mitigate or adapt to climate change, now is the time to get started.

There's more awareness of the problem than ever before, and that means there's also more interest in solutions.

-Investors are looking for promising startups to invest in.

-Customers are looking for products and services that can help them reduce their impact on the environment.

So if you're working on a climate tech solution, don't wait any longer to get started.

Now is the time to take advantage of the growing interest and investment in this space.

But these solutions don't just come from big pharma or medical device companies.


They come from entrepreneurs who see a problem and have the vision and drive to solve it.


But being an entrepreneur is not easy.


It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and resilience.


That's why we need more people supporting entrepreneurs ‚Äì whether it's through mentorship, funding, or simply spreading the word about their work.


So let's continue to encourage entrepreneurship in healthcare and support those who are working tirelessly to make a difference.


Below I share a list of 50 investors supporting #healthtech  companies.

(yes, that‚Äôs a graph of my actual bank balance)

- Work in corporate for years, save enough for a house deposit

- Watch as my pay + bonuses increase each year, making it harder to walk away. I was 27, in the top 25% of earners, and accelerating.

- Quit my job without even having a business idea. The only way I could make the jump: rip myself away from comfort.

- Immediately go from saving, to spending THOUSANDS each month just to exist. Ultimate accountability. Financial free fall.

- Spend almost my entire life savings over the next 3 years just existing (food, rent, basics)

- Fight tooth and nail to get to first revenue, then first funding round.

- Get paid ¬£0 for almost 2 years

- Then minimum wage for 1.5 more

- By year 4 of the startup, reached  the same salary I was on when I got my first grad job

- That lasted a few months‚Ä¶ Then Covid hit, and my pay got slashed again

/

Some other mundane truths‚Ä¶ I:

- Bought no new clothes for 5 years

- Did powerpoint-jockey work on the side for the first year

- Got wet feet because there were holes in my boots

- Ate the same ¬£3 meal deal from Tesco every day for years

- Lived in multiple crowded shared houses, sometimes in rooms where I could touch each wall when stretching out my arms

- Experienced mental health struggles, but didn't see a therapist because of the cost

- Watched as friends bought houses, made investments, had children. The relatability chasm grew.

- Would pay for drinks + meals for prospective investors when they wouldn‚Äôt offer to pay (which was often). I‚Äôd cut back on my own social expenditure to afford it.

- Didn't attend birthdays, weddings, trips because I couldn‚Äôt afford the travel & accommodation

/

There‚Äôs been a lot of discussion about founder pay from the perspective of investors or ‚Äòstart up observers‚Äô.

There hasn‚Äôt been a lot of discussion about what it really feels like as a Founder making the leap.

No matter where your pay checks eventually come from (be it investors/VC, revenue, side-hustles‚Ä¶), when you first choose entrepreneurship, you choose to strip away all sense of safety.

To begin with, there is ZERO. And your income will continue to be zero until you bend the universe to make it more than zero.

There‚Äôs no zoo keeper to feed you, no cage between you and everything else. 

It‚Äôs just naked you, vs big cruel, wants-to-kill-you jungle.

/

Personally, I wouldn't change any of my experience... it was all part of the 'leap of faith'. 

It might read like a sob story, it was actually really bloody fun, and a privilege. I loved it.

All the forgone income bought me knowledge. That knowledge is compounding every day, and will pay back HUGE ROI. I‚Äôm certain.

This isn‚Äôt meant to glamorise the financial struggles of being a Founder.

It‚Äôs supposed to light a fire in anyone who reads this and thinks - yeah, I‚Äôm up for that üî•

I‚Äôve long admired the work of Camilla, Emma, and Anna-Sophie and how they‚Äôre fighting for more equitable financial markets.

Today, we‚Äôre thrilled to announce that Female Invest has bought Gaia‚Äôs investment platform and that key talent from Gaia will join the team at Female Invest.

We set out to build Gaia with a vision of creating a new financial system that aligned people, planet, and profit. That‚Äôs also what Female Invest is working towards and so I couldn‚Äôt imagine a better new home for Gaia.

I can‚Äôt wait to see what the team at Female Invest will do with the platform.

Personally, I will take some time to recharge while exploring what‚Äôs next. I‚Äôm excited to dive into a new problem space and apply some of the (many) learnings from building Gaia.

If you ever wanted to grab coffee with me, now is a good time ‚òï

Thank you to everyone who has been part of the Gaia journey. It‚Äôs been an amazing ride.

The French culinary phrase ‚ÄúMise En Place‚Äù refers to having all your ingredients ready before you cook.

Similarly, it‚Äôs important to have all your documents ready to go before you start fundraising.

Documents to keep ready & organised.

1.) Pipeline for investors - A lightweight list of potential investors to contact, which can be shared with mentors and allies who can help with introductions.

2.) Process starter email - The content you will use to personally engage key mentors in your process.

3.) Investor CRM - What you use to actually manage the process.

4.) Forward-able email - Personal context + written one liner + 1-2 overview paragraphs. (Mentors will forward this to investors.)

5.) Emailable pitchdeck - Be careful with this, don‚Äôt send by default

6.) Meeting pitchdeck - Be ready with it but don‚Äôt force it (Share only when asked for)

7.) Financial model - Super important especially for meetings. Know the impact of key assumptions.

8.) Cap table - Necessary for due diligence

9.) Data room - A shared drive that contains financial model, cap table, founder bios, meeting deck, any IP documents, anything else you want investor to see.

What not share without being requested or knowing the investor (assume that your email can be shared with others too)

-Financial model.
-Cap table.
-Competitive advantage.
-Revenue/projections.
-Data room.
-Meeting deck.

-Your slides can‚Äôt be too detailed or wordy.



-Your deck needs to have a clear structure.



-Need to have an aha! the moment where you are communicating a new insight to an investor. 




It's about creating ""I‚Äôve never thought about it that way before!"" type of moments.

Amidst the crypto crash and backdrop of the market downturn, venture capital funds broke a record - for the¬†largest amount of capital¬†raised.

($151b) in any prior full-year, and the year‚Äôs not done yet! The surge has lined the pockets of venture funds with¬†nearly $300b of dry powder, a cash pile that‚Äôs ready to deploy.

These dedicated funds will delay any ensuing waves and maintain stability of capital flowing to climate cos.

Here is what Mia Diawara, a partner at¬†Lowercarbon Capital, a climate-focused VC fund that has backed a wide range of new tech, says they look out before funding a startup.

1. Stage fit‚Äîwe like to partner with teams early, generally at the pre-seed or seed stage of company building.

2. Thesis fit‚Äîwe‚Äôre looking for founders making products that are better, faster, sexier, cheaper than the carbon-intensive incumbents.

3. Climate impact‚Äîfounders should be tackling industries that represent a big chunk of global emissions, or areas where the impacts of climate change will be most significant. And

4. Storytelling/communication‚Äîfounders need to understand and be able to communicate in clear, compelling terms why now is the time, and why they have an unfair advantage that makes their success inevitable. Being able to nail the delivery of those two points is a proxy for a founder‚Äôs ability to sell their product further down the road..

If you're an entrepreneur or CEO, you know how important it is to find the right investor fit for your company.

But with so many options out there, how do you know which one is right for you?

Here are three tips to help you find the best investor fit for your business:

Know what you're looking for:

It's also important to know what kind of investment you're looking for before meeting with potential investors.

Are you looking for seed funding? Or are you further along in your journey and looking for Series A or B funding? 

Knowing this will help you narrow down your search and focus on finding investors who are a good match for your needs.

Do your research:

Before meeting with any potential investors, it's important to do your homework and research their background and investment history.

This will help you get a better sense of whether they're a good fit for your company.

Be prepared to pitch:

When you meet with potential investors, be prepared to pitch your business in a concise and engaging way.

I love pre seed conversations. 

The founder is laser focused on the problem statement and the target market.

Instead of focusing on traction and metrics (boring and deceiving at early stage), founders and investors converse on possibility and potential. 

I especially love the ""AHA"" moment when the founder's vision hits me and we both nod our heads in agreement - ""this could work.""

Tips to get quick commitment:
Come to an investor with a flushed out vision, not a ""I need money fast for x,y,z problem.""

Try to predict what we will ask in a conversation. If they have legit answers to my questions then it indicates the level of sincerity of the founders - it's clear to me that they they have spoken with customers/stakeholders and have a deep understanding of the problem statement.

These are the people who are actually writing checks and investing in startups and startup founders (from seed stage.)

 If you're looking to raise money for your startup, get in touch with these investors.

Also, I have been seeing a lot of pitch without CAC, LTV and churn rate metrics if these metrics are a growth parameter in your industry then do include them. 

Investors want to see return for their investments and they do it by analysing market trends and market growth potential as a whole.

And these parameter are an important indicator to understand your position in the market.

1. leave plenty of consistent margins in every slide- Even when you have to tell your story in 10 -15 slides.

It was also one of the best pieces of advice I received from a senior designer (then working with clients like google and Reddit) who had agreed to review my work.

‚ÄúSakshi your ideas are brilliant but now learn to tell the same thing in less space‚Äù

It was very tough in the beginning as it forces you to think really hard to solve problems most simply and easily.

Every pixel feels like precious real estate but now when I look back at it (after 3 years), it was one of the best pieces of advice as it made all the difference.

2. Pick a colour scheme and stick to it (your own brand colours) if you are not an expert use this trick

-Pick one primary colour and one secondary colour ( for the background).

-For a text and heading use a tone lighter than the usual black.

3. Pick a simple font like Helvetica or Poppins: Use the same font family for all text.

¬†¬†Example: Helvetica bold - Headings.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†             Helvetica Regular - Subheading.¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†             Helvetica Light - Text. 

4. Pick a basic element for your presentation.

Example: A thin rectangle or a circle in the dominant colour you have selected. 

Use them to place below or near the text you want to emphasise on, consistently in different sizes.

5. Good alignment is you best friend and gives your presentations a premium & big brand feel (and takes up the most time)

-Use the self-align feature in presentation software though to let it work effectively make sure you have adjusted all your text box sizes and made the same.

With a large enough portfolio, they could have a distribution by age 33! 

That's how old I was when I started angel investing. They have a full TEN more years to generate returns.

This is critical because money compounds over time.

Men understand this. They invest early and often.

LADIES - it's never too early (or too late) to start VC fund / angel investing. 

One of my goals in life is to help more women learn about this asset class. I think that when women *really* start to invest, we'll finally make big gains towards gender equality. When women invest, we know that 3x more women founders are funded than when men invest. This directly impacts who is sitting in executive and board seats of the VC backed startups that eventually become some of the world's largest companies.

On this day November 8 a game Guitar hero was released (in 2005).

By a small developer and publisher ( Harmonix and RedOctane) who had decided to come together to try something new and unproven.

With no track record or previous success to back them up.

It was like getting into guerilla, rag-tag, ignoring the adults in the room, putting all the cards on the table, learning how to focus on a project and also kill their darlings.

But It was being made by people working for passion rather than financial gain.

(Though it didn't hurt that the latter came in spades.)

With no notion that the game they were working on would do more than break even, over the course of just nine months the two companies developed a game that altered the course of not only the game industry but the world.

By selling more than 25 million units.

Making more than $2 billion.

It created a watershed moment culturally, with some of the largest bands in the world seeking out their own deals with the company, hoping to cash in on the Guitar Hero boom.

Guitar Hero left a sizeable crater in the music industry and pop culture in general.

As Steve Jobs famously said ""Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.""

What if it turned out to be better for people who kept seeking opportunities amid these turbulent times?

When the news of adding new features and mass layoffs hit on various news sites, it put a question mark on the future of Twitter employees and also the communities that founders were actively building.

But if you notice Twitter itself was created at the time of crisis and succeeded because its parent company Odeo a podcasting platform experienced a halt in it's expansion due to apple announcing its podcasting platform.

That‚Äôs when Jack Dorsey‚Äôs lightbulb went off and he came up with a social networking site, which was based on a person‚Äôs ‚Äústatus.‚Äù

""After that first presentation about Twitter, Williams then CEO of Odeo put Glass in charge of the project,"".

While offering to buy back stock from investors to work full-time on Twitter. ( hoping to save investors a loss)

Odeo's investors accepted the deal as nobody thought that the company could be worth $44billion one day.

While everyone is enveloping themselves around twitter news some might take it as an opportunity and turn the tables around.

As they say, turbulent times build great leaders.

What do you think let me know?

If you're looking to raise money for your startup, this is the best time to do it.

This is when most investors are looking to invest in new companies and projects.

There are a few reasons why the fourth quarter is the best time to raise funding.

First, many investors have end-of-year budgets that they need to use before the end of the calendar year.

This means that they're more likely to invest in new companies during this time.

Second, many investors are looking to diversify their portfolios before the end of the year.

This means that they're more open to investing in new and innovative companies.

If your startup is working on something new and exciting, this is the perfect time to pitch it to investors.

Finally, many investors are simply more available during the fourth quarter.

They may be taking less vacation time or working on fewer projects, at this time.

Founders who have been raising from past few months let me know your opinion about it?

As a CEO, startup founder, or entrepreneur, you know that having a strong pitch presentation is essential to success.

It is the first introduction to you and your business and in most cases also the last.

But what about including a data room as part of your presentation?

A data room is a secure online space where you can store and share important business documents.

This can be incredibly helpful when pitching your business to potential investors, as it gives them a place to easily access all the information they need.

This gives you control to edit and update data anytime during the fundraising process.

Plus, using a data room can help you keep track of who has accessed which documents, ensuring that only authorised individuals are viewing sensitive information.

So if you're looking  make your startup stand out along with a compelling story and stunning pitch deck consider adding a data room.

It could make the difference in landing that crucial investment.

Number 3 is controversial but you know me üòà

Last week Canopey hit our funding target, and whilst the dust settles (and the legalities proceed!) I wanted to share my insights into raising money during these times...

I've written two posts so far - links in comments:

1. The ""most"" important doc for investors
2. What does ""early-stage"" really mean?

Today I wanted to talk about time ‚è∞

Now everyone will tell you that raising money is time-consuming, and you'll never truly believe how time-consuming it is until you've done it yourself..and you'll inevitably look back and think:

""Damn son, that was so time-consuming, they were right!""

We certainly did üò∂

Here are my top 4 tips for making it easier - it will still be time-consuming but, here's how to make it more efficient.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Build out a simple database of investors.

Every single investor/fund/VC/institution you reach out to - write them down. Name, email, website, and ticket size at the very least but one absolutely pivotal thing - a simple note on their response.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build out the data room before you start.

Don't worry you can edit it, and change it. But instead of leaving investors hanging, just have it all ready for them, you'll get a decision quicker. There's lots of stuff that could go in a data room, I'll go over that tomorrow üì£

3Ô∏è‚É£ Controversial one, but important: Spread the meetings out.

Most people will tell you to take as many meetings as possible all the time. They've never pitched, fundraised, or sold sh*t to anyone. Take it from someone who used to fundraise for the world's largest independent environmental organisation.

You NEED to take a break from pitching. Particularly after hearing no multiple times - which you will.

If not, your story will be monotonous and you won't really FEEL it every single time. Because ultimately you need them to be impassioned. 

So, take a breather, go back in refreshed, and get more people fired up.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Start early. I mean it.

Everyone says it, we all doubt it, and it's one hundred percent true. Need to raise money in December? Start prepping and talking about it in May. There are some caveats to this, but a general rule of thumb, give yourself 6 months. 

Our round took 9 months from prep to close. Admittedly, there was a proxy-world war, an economic crash, an energy crisis, and the tech bubble burst...but still, plan, prep, and give yourself time in order to save time.

üéâ BONUS

Take advice.

No one likes to admit they don't know something, but the best founders are the ones who are willing to listen within their confidence.

Fundraising is no different. Speak to your advisors. Read AngelThink by Phil McSweeney as a starting point.

I'm writing about Canopey's experience fundraising. More to come!

Finding investors is hard, but knowing where to look is the first step.
After seeing all your options, you can then work on making your chances of getting accepted greater.

Before you send your deck to investors, make sure you have read their thesis and previous investments.

It's important to understand what an investor is looking for before pitching your company.

By reading their thesis, you can get a better sense of what they're interested in and what kind of companies they've invested in before.

By doing your research, you'll be able to tailor your pitch more effectively and increase your chances of getting funded!

Step 1: Find out WHO invests in your country 

You could have everything going for you (story, team, traction, vision), but if a US firm will only invest in Delaware C-Corps‚Ä¶well then you‚Äôre SOL (Sh*t Out of Luck for my overseas friends)

Step 2: Learn how international investments differ for US focused investors. 

There is a special activation energy / hurdle that these deals require. It‚Äôs similar to any domestically focused fundraise, it just requires‚Ä¶more

I‚Äôm working on content to help with both steps but it‚Äôs pretty country specific

Here‚Äôs what I can do now.  

I‚Äôve been focused on Brazil leading up to a fundraising event for founders in S√£o Paulo on Nov 11.

For Brazilian founders, my team and I asked around, jumped into databases, and dove into LinkedIn to get you started with Step 1

We have COMPLETED a list of 250+ investors across 142 Funds (with linkedin profile URLs) who in the last 2 years have been part of $1B deals and are working on a list of 140+ funds who have done multiple deals over the last 2 yrs between $1-25MM in size.

This took forever to do, so i'm happy to be able to share with the community...

‚Ä¶

But a list is only the start

For Step 2 - if you‚Äôre in S√£o Paulo on Nov 11 - you should come to our Fundraising Fundadores event to hear how the best international investing gets done.  And you won't just be trusting my word... we have experts from Latitud as well as special guests from the US and international investors joining us to help fill in the gaps! Learn from the best and expand your network!

I‚Äôve included the link to my live event that I‚Äôm hosting with Latitud (the YC of LATAM) in the first comments

If you're a startup founder, you know how important it is to have a strong network of investors.

But what if I told you that there's are investors who don't require a warm intro?

So if you're looking to expand your investor network, be sure to check out the ""No Warm Intro Required"" list.

This list includes over 100 investors who are open to meeting with startups without a referral or introduction.

It just might be the key to unlocking your next round of funding.

Before you hit ""send,"" there are 5 things you must take care off: 

1. Share your deck in pdf format or include a link to the deck.

Make it easy for VCs to access your deck from multiple devices. (if you already have some revenue or funding, then descend might be a good investment)

2. Personalize each email 

Generic emails are a turn-off and will likely be ignored (Even after demoday). Take the time to research each investor/ VC firm thesis and tailor your pitch accordingly.

3. Keep it short and sweet 

No one wants to read a long, drawn-out email. Get to the point quickly and be concise.

4. Take into account the information they'll need to make a decision 

Including their due diligence team members who may not have been able to attend demo day and has no idea about your business.

5. Avoid animations, transitions or videos in your email pitch deck 

 Make it easy to go back and forth between the slides.

This is what I've learned from building Luna's story:  
 

1. Telling the story of how the business started isn't enough. It needs to be emotive. It needs to give someone a feeling inside. 
 
2. You know you're telling a great story if early on you get a ""yeah I can totally see that"". Make sure you hook your story around a common problem which is relatable.  
 
3. Don't overshare the story. My biggest mistake as a first time founder raising money was the classic founder brain dump. It leaves investors wondering what the fuck just happened.  
 
4. Telling your FOUNDER story in such a way that drives confidence is make or break at the earliest stage. You become investable by having confidence in your ability to build.  
 

Honestly, learning how to become a good storyteller is the best thing I've done over the past 3 years üëè

Because they help what you‚Äôre saying resonate in your audience‚Äôs mind without pulling their attention from your spoken words.



Simple, punchy photos in presentations can make a huge difference,


For instance, we recently crafted a pitch deck for a sustainability startup #Superkons 


Where we used this image of a sea tortoise about to eat a  bottle.


The point we wanted to make in the audience's mind  was its URGENT 


While we see this presentation and decide whether to fund this startup idea or not 


Species are dying because of ocean plastic and we need to act now to fund and support sustainable product alternatives like Superkons

---

Pro-tip for your next presentation

Look for photos that

(1) Speak strongly to the concept you‚Äôre talking about and

(2) Aren‚Äôt compositionally complex.

Your photo could be a metaphor or something more literal, but it should be clear why the audience is looking at it,

And why it‚Äôs paired with what you‚Äôre saying.

People invest in people:

They want to know they'll be funding highly skilled, deeply-committed founders

And your pitch deck needs to sell your team as much as it does your product.

Especially, if you are pre-revenue/ pre-product market fit 

Then your startup is nothing more than your team, vision, and your ability to tell your story. 

So, don't wait to introduce your team till the last, 

Instead, include your team bio in the first 2-3 slides. 

Plan your story and deck flow accordingly.

In a good pitch deck, each slide feels like part of the same story.

Creating a consistent look and feel is a must

This means

1. Using¬†the same or related typography,
2. Consistent colour pallet and
3. Same imagery style across all slides.

These vital can give you a huge advantage over
pre-built master slides which might¬†feel¬†restrictive sometimes.

But there's a problem:

It's really easy to get caught up in the fear of how we might be perceived by others.

This worry can cause creators to:

- Hold back their thoughts and ideas
- Be extremely vanilla and boring
- Censor themselves altogether

I‚Äôve lived it firsthand: 

I write something valuable that I know can help people, but start worrying about the what-about-ists and the nitpickers who will peck my words to death.

That‚Äôs exactly what happened recently to one of my coaching-clients-turned-friends here on LinkedIn.

He wanted to share a piece of content that talked about how he invested in himself and his business in 2022.

But he was afraid.

He worried it would be insensitive.

So, he didn't share it.

Then, in our call, I pushed him to post it.

And what happened next was pretty magical.

(and wanted to grow an audience and business)


1/ Embrace An Obsession:

When you embrace an obsession, you rarely need other external motivation.

You wake up each day with an intense desire to become the best in your specific obsession.

What can you research, break down, & share daily, that would feel like play instead of work?


2/ Develop Unique Knowledge:

This is the knowledge you have acquired on your unique journey, that other people want, but can‚Äôt figure out.

The best way to develop unique knowledge is by putting maximum effort into exploring your obsession.

When you do that, you learn more than the average person, and your knowledge becomes uniquely valuable to them.


3/ Challenge Pre-conceived Solutions:

A lot of LinkedIn creators shine a light on problems, but then they fail to create differentiated solutions.

They have the same pitch, same buzzwords, and the same jargon as everyone else.

Instead, you should leverage your unique knowledge to bring a solution that's completely different than anything on the market.

Stand out by promising and delivering on something unorthodox.


4/ Build Distribution By Studying People:

To turn your content into dollars, people must know you exist.

And if you have unique knowledge, you owe it to the world to get it into their hands.

Don‚Äôt copy your competition.

Instead, study human psychology, marketing, and persuasion.

And talk about that unique solution every single day online.

Build a small audience journey that takes people through discovery > trust >relationship > purchase.


5/ Scale Using Compounding, Daily Media:

Take 30 minutes each day to observe what you learned.

Tell stories, show examples, and share behind the scenes.

Content works on your behalf for hours & sometimes even days.

Classic pieces of content have lasted years or even decades.

Have at least 2 pieces of content working on your behalf in the world at all times.


TL;DR

1. Embrace your obsession
2. Develop unique knowledge
3. Challenge pre-conceived solutions
4. Build distribution by studying people
5. Scale using compounding, daily media


I share daily content about my approach to work and life that prioritizes independence, flexibility, & fulfillment.

Writing code.
Building SaaS products.
Creating recurring revenue.

Then, something kind of funny happened.

Courtland and Channing Allen, who run Indie Hackers, reached out to me and asked if I'd be a part of their show last month.

Candidly, I was a bit flabbergasted.

This digital course guy? This guy who can't write a line of code?

No way.

But, it happened.

And like a kid in a candy store, I smiled the entire way through it.

(Using only LinkedIn for leads)

Here's how:

1. Choose a skill you want to get 10x better at (example: SEO).

2. Change your LinkedIn profile to reflect your new journey:

i.e. ""On a mission to simplify SEO for new creators and online entrepreneurs.""

3. Spend the next 90 days devouring everything you can about SEO.

4. At the end of each day, write down 1-2 lessons that you learned.

5. Create content daily sharing those lessons.

6. When people ask you questions, DM them.

7. Ask them if they'd like to talk for free, to see if you can help.

8. Do 10 of these calls to better understand - what are the biggest pains?

9. Create a process you can walk people through in 60 minutes to solve those.

10. Then go to Carrd and build a simple personal website for $19

11. Open up a free Stripe account and create a paid service (Ex: $500)

12. Create a brand new service offering based on the pains above:

i.e. ""High-Value Keyword Analysis and SEO Roadmap for New Creators""

13. Open up a free Calendly and create the same exact event.

14. Open up a few slots outside of your 9 to 5.

15. Add a ""Buy"" button to your Carrd page and redirect it to Stripe checkout.

16. After the payment, redirect Stripe checkout to the Calendly account.

17. Then, add your website to your LinkedIn featured section.

18. Continue educating yourself every single day.

19. Continue sharing fresh, new content every single day.

20. When people ask questions, direct them to the link to pay.

The client was a highly regarded entrepreneur in my space, and when he signed the agreement, I remember thinking,  ""what was I going to teach him?""

I prepared for hours to make sure I was ready to have the most robust conversation in history. 

I had workbooks, notepads, excel sheets of information, and formulas.

I was ready.

When the meeting began, we started breaking down his content & business.

- He didn‚Äôt have a marketing strategy.
- He didn‚Äôt have any appropriate technology.
- He wasn‚Äôt measuring his content analytics effectively.

I remember sitting there with my mouth agape.

Needless to say, this has been a very similar story in many of my engagements. 

Remember that the information you‚Äôre familiar with is not always common knowledge.

You know more than you think you do.

And that's what I commonly refer to as ""knowledge blindness"".

Our inability to see our knowledge as extremely useful rather than, ""stuff everyone knows"". 

Knowledge Blindness is a big part of why many people never start sharing, never start writing, and never stop building.

It's 1 of 5 things I noticed about my Impostor Syndrome when I started trying to fix it.

My ""4 Hypotheses"" Model:


My course on using LinkedIn as a business tool has over 10,900 students and thousands of 5-star reviews.

One of the most common pieces of feedback I receive is that it's ""a game changer, especially at the price"".

That's how I want people to feel!

But deciding what to price the course at is always a really difficult decision.

So I made 4 hypotheses to eventually end up at the right price point:


Hypothesis 1: Make it accessible

I guessed that most people would be at the beginning or intermediate stages of leveraging LinkedIn.

My hypothesis was that pricing should skew low to capture that audience.

Outcome: Needs to be less than $300.


Hypothesis 2: Make it easy to buy, fast

I wanted to make it what I call, a ""Quasi-impulse"" buy.

Low enough to be easy to buy the first time they saw it, but high enough to be taken seriously and also to earn significant revenue.

Outcome: To make it a quasi-impulse buy, it probably needs to be less than $200.


Hypothesis 3: Driving word-of-mouth & affiliates would make it viral

Word-of-mouth and affiliate sales only make sense at a lower price point. 

Noting hypothesis 1, the majority of users won‚Äôt feel comfortable referring friends to something incredibly expensive.

""Hey, bud - check out this thing I bought. You should buy it too. It's only $2,997!""

Not gonna happen.

Outcome: Drop to $150.


Hypothesis 4: The 3rd hypothesis will accelerate with global adoption.

Make sure to include PPP (purchase power parity). 

This will incentivize purchases from other countries. 

Those purchasers would be likely to enroll in the affiliate program, too.

Outcome: Include PPP discounts.


The results?

- Price: $150
- PPP Discount: 20% to 60% by country
- Students: 10,900
- Revenue: $1.345M
- Timeline: 18 months
- DM's and emails from happy customers: Thousands

And that's it. 

My 4 hypotheses model.

And I have no idea how to write code.

Use these 10 steps to start your journey (without all of my mistakes):


1/ Eliminate the ""fallacy of expertise""

When you get started, don't think, ""am I an expert?""

If you do, you'll never start.

Instead, make a list of your accomplishments, big & small, over the last 2-3 years.

What skills did you learn during this period?


2/ Identify your interests

Inside the list you just created, will be things you loved & hated doing.

Sorry, but misery doesn't scale.

Choose something you built skills in, that you enjoy doing & talking about.

This will be your focus.


3/ Find the ""you"" from 2-3 years ago

Your goal is to find people who are just like you, but much earlier in their journey.

Where do they hang out? Try places like:

- Reddit
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- FB Groups

If you can't find them, use tools like SparkToro to help.


4/ Create content

Next, it's time to establish credibility.

Here are some easy ways:

- Teardowns
- Newsletters
- Step-by-step guides

Document everything you learn & share it!

Show the people 2-3 years behind you that you understand their challenges & have solved them.

This will gain you a small following.


5/ Create a service business

A simple service business can be your 1st income stream.

An MVP landing page + Stripe to collect payments.

The key? Make the pricing a no-brainer.

You're not looking to get rich, you're looking to learn & help.


6/ Promote it

You won't get clients just because you exist.

Instead, find easy ways to promote it.

When your new followers ask you questions, tell them about your business.

When you write content, share a link at the end.

Simple stuff.


7/ Listen for commonalities

This is a key step to creating your 2nd income stream.

Your goal when coaching is to listen for the most common problems you hear.

- Write down every problem you hear
- Dive deeper to understand them
- Keep a running list

This is the gold.


8/ Build a digital product

Your 2nd income stream is your 1st digital product. Focused on the most common problem above.

Take someone from problem to solution in < 60 minutes.

Keep it focused.

Single problem ‚Üí single solution

Price it reasonably to build trust.


9/ Raise your rates

With a lower-priced product, you can now increase your rates.

When people want a service, you can help 1:1.

When they want to learn on their own, you have a product.

You now have an offering for different learning styles & price points.


10/ Set up your systems

- Create useful content
- Drive people to the product
- Upsell service packages to help

With this simple system, it's only a matter of time before you add a 3rd income stream:

- Consulting
- Community
- Physical products
- Cohort-based coaching

Next?

Get started!

$1 becomes $10.
$10 becomes $1,000.
$1,000 becomes $100,000.

1. Start a coaching or consulting business

Why I like a service-based business:

Generally, easier and lower cost to get started.

Plus you can likely charge 2x to 5x what you make (hourly) at your 9 to 5 job.


2. Create a digital course

Why I like digital courses:

People can purchase the courses 24/7, plus you have the opportunity to create a nice affiliate program that drives even more sales.


3. Build a paid community

Why I like paid communities:

Building a space where people of similar interests can congregate improves your brand, builds trust, & deepens relationships.

This helps grow your audience and build your business.

Get community right and it's the most powerful of all of these (but the hardest).


4. Start a subscription email

Why I like subscription emails:

The scale is incredible.

As the customer base grows, the work effort generally remains the same, meaning that you make more money without much extra work.

I can't imagine spending the prime of my life missing my wife, not being able to explore the world or see my parents before they are gone.

5. Loyalty:

In case you've missed it, companies are laying folks off at a pretty rapid pace.

Newsflash: You're a line on a spreadsheet until the math doesn't work out.

The days of 30+ year careers at companies are over.

Employ yourself and you'll get the boss you deserve.

6. Leverage:

If you build a successful online business, you create incredible leverage.

You become harder to control. You can say no more. You can take time when you want.

You control the effort and how big you want to go.

You're the decision-maker.

7. Flexibility:

Want to take Johnny on a fishing trip?

Want to accompany your aging parents to Japan for their dream vacation?

No more ""Damn, my boss says no"" while telling your friends about the great work/life balance at your company.

Say yes to everything that matters.

8. Purpose:

When you were growing up, did you dream of sitting in a cubicle & talking to customers about some random integrated multi-platform functionality that will probably fail to IPO?

No.

Instead, choose a curious obsession and go find people who need what you're selling.

9. Joy:

We all think we want happiness, but what we really want is joy.

Happiness is fleeting moments. Joy means making an important impact during our lives.

By betting on yourself and aligning with a higher purpose, you give yourself the best shot of living a joyful life.

10. Regret:

Don't look back in 10 years and wish you got started earlier.

Could you fail? Absolutely.
Will you make mistakes? 100%

Will you recover and always be able to find a job again if you're talented? Definitely.

At least give it a shot in 2023.

I'm rooting for you.",2700,,0,,0,,0,,,Text,,,,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7025455064810971137,0,640,5705,0,0,2/20/2023 19:12

Promise:  Open your content with a bold promise to intrigue the reader.

Picture: Paint a vivid picture of their life once the promise is delivered.

Proof: Show the reader why they should trust you.

Push: Push them to take an action.

I documented the whole thing.

Why do speed and cost matter when you're building an MVP?

Because it's important to move fast, test, and try your best to prove an idea before you ever invest a meaningful amount of time in building it.

Unfortunately, my calendar is littered with past coaching calls where people tell me about the 6 months they spent building a product, course, service business, etc. that nobody ended up buying or even caring about.

I want to put a stop to that.

So I experimented with building an MVP for a startup that will send a locally contracted dog walker to any house in my neighborhood for a 20-minute, $35 walk.

The entire business will be automated, cost less than $25 and 30 minutes to build, and be fully functional with zero code.

Let‚Äôs build a Rover competitor.

But there was a big problem.

When I talked to other peers of mine across multiple companies, it became apparent that many people at the height of their jobs were pretty miserable.

There is nothing more deflating than spending your entire career climbing a mountain only to find out that the view isn't quite what you thought it was.

The responsibility didn't matter as much.
The money didn't matter as much.
The title didn't matter as much.
The impact didn't matter as much.

In the end, it was long hours, incredible stress, and a goalpost that moved every quarter.

It wasn't a matter of IF you'll eventually get fired.
It was simply a matter of when.

This is the lifestyle that I decided to run away from on August 1st of 2019.

I've spent the last 3.5 years talking a lot about social media, LinkedIn, Twitter, digital products, etc.

But, those are all just tools.

Tools that we can use to equip ourselves in the modern digital world.

Tools that help people design a better life. A more intentional life.

A life where they can spend time with their family & friends, doing whatever it is they want to do while doing very little of what they don't.

A life of limited obligations and increased enjoyment.

It's our one and only shot. 

I want to help people enjoy it.

As I cross 15,000 students in my products, I want to think about new and unique ways to help people redesign their lives.

2023 and 2024 should be really interesting.

If she can do it, anyone can do it.

Here's the story:

My Mom opened her own small business in 1990.

She taught aerobic dancing to a small group of women who wanted a low-impact, high-intensity way to stay in shape.

But, like many businesses, the pandemic made it impossible for her to continue.

The school she rented space from was no longer hosting in-person classes of any kind.

So, I showed her how to set up a Zoom account.

She bought a little mic she could clip on.

And I helped her upload the music and dance cues to the computer.

Two years later, my Mom runs her business on the internet from a small town called Novelty, Ohio.

Dancing like a maniac on her screened-in porch.

The class is smaller. Maybe 15 people. Maybe 20. I'm not sure.

I don't think she charges more than $15-$20 per month.

And that's it.

She found something she loved doing.
She found other people who wanted the same outcome.
She set it up for almost no cost and brought everyone together.

An internet community of 70-year-old ladies.

Kicking a**, making some money, and staying in shape.

And that's how my Mom became an internet entrepreneur.

I like to think if my Mom were 22 or 27, or maybe 35 or 42, she'd be on Instagram or LinkedIn sharing her workouts and building a 6-figure business.

But she isn't.

Maybe you are?

Maybe there's something you do every day or every week that other people would like to do with you?

If so, you should join 76,000+ internet entrepreneurs in my weekly newsletter here: https://lnkd.in/eXv2Mxfg

And learn to launch, grow, and monetize your own little internet business.

Maybe even a big one.

I hope this gets some creative juices flowing this Wednesday morning.

Cheers.

- Service: Over time, people who want help will ask for it. Set a fair price and start having conversations focused on learning where everyone else is struggling.

Take every piece of advice in this thread with a grain of salt.

A few months ago, I had a 30-minute meeting with a friend of mine named Blake Burge to talk about improving his business's revenue.

Blake has a massive Twitter following and is an Excel wizard who creates helpful threads for other Excel users.

But, Blake was facing a challenge that other creators face: 

He was getting in his own way turning attention into revenue.

He had been selling a $49 Excel course and was hardly getting any traction.

So I asked him to walk me through the most common way that someone becomes a customer of his product.

Here was his previous sales process:

Step 1: Prospect reads a Twitter thread of Blake‚Äôs

Step 2: Prospect moves from thread to website to download free Excel templates

Step 3: Prospect receives the free Excel template & is moved to an email sequence

Step 4: Prospect is pitched a $49 Excel course over several emails

Step 5: Purchase is made or the email sequence ends with $0

This math is extremely challenging.

Even if Blake gets 2,000,000 impressions on his thread, he might get 400 free template downloads.

From there, he‚Äôd be lucky if 10% (40) of those people opened it up and started the template. 

Free products are easy to ignore because there is no skin in the game.

Of those 40 people, he might convert 1.5% for 0.6 customers or $29.40 per thread.

There‚Äôs no way that should be happening.

Want to learn how we fixed it and 76x'ed his average thread revenue?

1,600 layoffs per day in 2023.

40-hour workweeks are now 60+ hours.

Picking up the slack because their company fired 10% and now they are leaning harder than ever on the top performers who are still around.

So, everything is starting to blend together.

Their family time is now company time.
Their dinners are spent checking their iPhones.
Their evenings get interrupted by company emails.

Jobs regularly invading family time is the new norm.

Crazy.

I talk to people like this daily who are walking away and choosing to find companies that embrace balance & creativity.

Or recognizing that their side projects can become full-time with a bit more focus.

Probably not. Here's what you should do instead:

1. Check your employee agreement

Can you work on a side hustle while employed?

It's always good to double-check your agreement with your employer first.

If you're good to go, next...


2. Embrace an obsession

Find something you're obsessed with an dive in.

When you love something, you rarely need external motivation.

You wake up each day with an intense desire to become the best in your specific obsession.

So ask yourself this:

‚ÄúWhat am I absolutely obsessed with? What could I research, break down, and share with the world daily, that would feel like play instead of work?‚Äù


3. Acquire unique knowledge

The best way to develop this unique knowledge is by putting maximum effort into exploring your obsession.

For example, there are a million ‚Äúproductivity experts‚Äù and books on building better habits.

But James Clear‚Äôs book, Atomic Habits, stands head and shoulders above the rest.

Why?

Because his obsession with habits led him on a unique journey all his own.

And out of that journey came unique knowledge like:

- Habit Stacking
- Plateau of Latent Potential
- The 3 layers of Behavioral Change

Nobody can compete with James, because in a world of boring academic and scientific studies, James translated his obsession into unique knowledge that only he has.


4. Build distribution

Study human psychology, marketing, and persuasion.

Don‚Äôt copy your competition.

Once you understand how to generate attention, set up a simple customer journey that increases awareness, trust, and relationships.


5. Scale using digital media

Take 30 minutes at the end of each day to observe what you accomplished or learned that day.

What can you share with your audience that's a uniquely specific learning to you?

Tell stories, use metaphors, show real word examples, share behind the scenes, challenge conventional thinking, etc.

Every piece of content works on your behalf for hours, days, and sometimes - weeks.

Classic pieces of content have lasted years or even decades. That's the power of media.


TL;DR

1. Check your employee agreement
2. Embrace an obsession
3. Acquire unique knowledge
4. Build distribution
5. Scale using digital media

Here's a simple breakdown of 5 types of traffic (and how to get some):

1/ Direct Traffic:

Direct traffic basically means users who visit your site by directly typing in the URL.

Why it's good: Shows your brand is becoming popular with searchers.

How to get some: Become known for one specific thing & increase your social presence & social network.


2/ Organic Traffic:

Organic traffic comes from visits to your website through different search engines.

Why it's good: This traffic comes from people searching for something specific, increasing your lead quality.

How to get some: Analyze keyword gaps & low-competition keywords to start.


3/ Referral Traffic:

Referral traffic happens when someone visits your website by clicking on a link from somewhere else.

Why it's good: Sends potentially qualified visitors to your website from trusted sources.

How to get some: Find guest blog post or podcast guest opportunities, or trade newsletter mentions with someone relevant in your space.


4/ Social Media Traffic:

Social media traffic means people visit your website after clicking on a social media post.

Why it's good: Builds a lot more awareness at the top of your marketing funnel!

How to get some: Post regularly, cross-post to relevant sites & drive people to the website on your profile.


5/ Paid Traffic:

Paid traffic comes from people who visit your website after clicking on an ad that you paid for.

Why it's good: Fast, easier to track, campaign optimizations, etc.

How to get some: Run ads (Meta, Insta, LinkedIn, etc.) or hire an agency to run ads on your behalf.


To recap the 5 types of web traffic:

- Direct Traffic
- Organic Traffic
- Referral Traffic
- Social Traffic
- Paid Traffic

Here's my recommendation: 

Attack one channel and get really, really good at it. Then bolt on another.

Start with Social - it forms the foundation for your brand and awareness. By doing well on social, you'll influence Direct, Referral, and Organic a bit. 

Then, consider investing in a long-term organic (SEO) strategy. My opinion is that Paid becomes much easier when you have a formidable brand. Consider that last.

Please don't try to master them all at once.

That's the question so many people have. 

For me, the answer became clear in 2018 - it was time to break free from the constraints of the traditional workforce and forge my own path.

My first step? Simple - I let go of ambition.

No more chasing after the next big thing.

No grandiose desire to leave a mark on the world, or the need for external validation. 

Instead, I focused on what truly brought me fulfillment - working on projects I was passionate about with people I cared about, the freedom to travel and spend time with loved ones, and the ability to say goodbye to tasks that drained my energy.

Why am I writing this here on LinkedIn?

I grew up in a society where HIV and AIDS were taboo topics.

Where people made jokes about sex and disease.

Where parents avoided talking about AIDS prevention.

Where no one dared to get tested.

But this is not a joke. This is a tragedy.

Because they are too afraid to get tested.

Because they think it is a shame.

Because they don't know the truth:

HIV testing is not a #shame. It is #courage.

It is a way to save your life. It is a way to protect your partner's life. It is a way to save the world.

This post is going to get avoided by most people who read this.

But it is important...

At 50, my mom decided to start her own business. 

She noticed many youngsters living in Lucknow who had to settle for education or job purposes were missing their home food.

She decided to provide meals to these youngsters in boxes full of food and, of course, mom's love.

She had enough infrastructure to cook food but had no means of delivering it to them.

That is when she got to know about Porter. Their services were so affordable and easy to book. 

She began by delivering these boxes across Lucknow using services by Porter. Their employees would use bikes to deliver food across Lucknow, cutting through the traffic.

The youngsters were delighted with the quality of the food and precise delivery. She started getting demands from other cities as well.

She made homemade snacks and took the help of a porter whose staff would pack the boxes in secure cartons, pick them up in their trucks and deliver them across Uttar Pradesh hassle-free.

She is now serving 1000s of young people!

I was walking on road and saw a woman hit by the truck.

No one stopped to check on #woman. 

She was lying there on road...waiting for her death!

I picked up the lady and rushed to a nearby hospital. 

The doctor thanked me for bringing the woman on time. 

He said....I saved her life. 

I felt good ! 

Soon, I learned the woman was a relative of Tim Cook!! The CEO of #Apple 

I was shocked! 

Tim Cook soon arrived at hospital and thanked me. 

To be honest, I was #nervous meeting him but he calmed me down. 

We went on to talk & had great conversation about tech, brand building & society.

And then...all of a sudden he offered me a Marketing job at Apple. 

I was overwhelmed. 

But then, I politely refused him and told him, I want a job based on my skills and not based on my good deeds. 

He looked at me & smiled...and said he is #proud of a youngster like me! 

I dont remember what happened after that.... cz my househelp Kanta Bai came to my room to do jhaadu, switched off the fan, my dream broke & I woke up! üòè

Me - Oh okay. But if I work hard, I'll get the 100% PLI right?

HR - To be very honest, in our last 5 years of work, only 1 of our employee was able to get the 100% PLI.

Me - Wow, he must be very hardworking, would love to meet him soon.

HR - Actually, he's the son-in-law of the CEO.

As you may already know, I have been very vocal about skill and hard work beating luck.

Taking control of the controllables and not letting the variables stop you from doing
What you want is my current mantra. In order to understand this better, let‚Äôs deep dive into Poker a bit.

For all those who don‚Äôt know, Poker is a card game played with analytics and decision-making as some of the primary skills. When you win a hand, you gain insights.

When you lose a hand, you gain learnings. The sport also teaches you self accountability, which is very important to remove luck and other variables out of the equation and focus only on hard work. 

I learnt this not only in Poker but I learned this during my initial career as well. 

After Class 12, I did what was expected of me by society. I did engineering and while applying to colleges, I got rejected because I‚Äôd gotten 0.01% less than the cut-off of a Tier 3 engineering college. 

Instead of blaming the situation or my ‚ÄòLUCK‚Äô, I learned to manage my time properly and keep pushing forward.

I began prepping for my GMAT exams, worked hard, and actually became one of the top 5% of scorers in the world! 

This helped me get a scholarship at Washington University where I am currently pursuing my MBA.

PokerBaazi Baazi Games has done a good job in diving into every aspect of Business through the lens of Poker and the larger messaging is nothing short of relatable and completely applicable in life, Business and in Poker.

But then I saw Blinkit, Instacart, etc., and was SHOCKED to see the eggs delivered in freaking 7 minutes! 

How is that even possible? 

I was numb for those 7 mins. 

Indian companies have mastered the supply chain challenges!

----

I was later entering the airport and took out my Id card for the scan. 

The CRPF person politely refused. 

They just scanned my face and let me in because of #DigiYatra. 

I was SHOCKED again! 

I have been to North America, Europe, South America... they ask for Id cards everywhere.

#1 Position yourself as a high-valued candidate
Avoid doing the norm and blending in with other candidates; you are doing yourself a disservice. The market is very competitive, and you must stand out amongst the pack. Think from a bird‚Äôs eye view and not a head on point of view. If you follow the crowd, you will be like the crowd. Go against the grain to strategically stand out. 

#2 Network and Build Relationships
Job boards are great to apply to the roles of your interests, but you are still doing the same as everyone else. On average, there are 250+ candidates applying to the same role as you, so how are you shining bright? 

LinkedIn is your strongest ally and the strongest platform to network. Start connecting NOW to access the hidden gems. Believe it or not, most companies are big on hiring via internal referrals or even through their external partnerships with talent and recruiting firms. Use the resource of networking to your advantage. 

To position yourself better, please apply to the job first ‚Äì then reach out to your network as this will move the process along more seamlessly. 

#3 Tailor your experience and conversation
In the unavoidable ‚Äútell me about yourself‚Äù question, highlight the most relevant and impactful components and skills of your career. This response should be tailored to the role that you are interviewing for. No need to go around the world, get straight to the point and be tactful. 

This is why researching before a job interview is very important because you will understand what the company does and what they are looking for in a candidate. Speak to what they are needing. Your skill set is a service to be offered as a solution to their needs.

You should update your resume every 6 to 12 months. 

Each year you will develop new skills and progressive experience. Your resume should reflect any certificates, licenses, or training programs you have earned. Keeping your resume current with skills and experiences will be helpful even if you aren't seeking a new job because you can use it to advocate for yourself when applying for a promotion or requesting a raise.

Throughout this period of time, you will want to keep a log to track your accomplishments, successors, and progression. 

Tracking your progress along the way, will prevent you from having to think back on ‚Äúhow you have contributed through quantifiable accomplishments"" and have a real time list where never goes unnoticed.   

A rule of thumb is to always have a targeted resume based on your goals and roles that you are in pursuit of. 

If you‚Äôre able to show your perceived value on your resume, this will allow you to be a competitive candidate and separate you from the bunch.

Tell me about yourself . . .

What they are pursuing is a quick overview of your professional experience before you move into details. 

Keep your response short, simple, and sweet.

Talk about: 
- Your experience
- Your Strengths

These two quick snapshots should be relevant to the role you are applying and interviewing for.

3 Common Reasons Why & How to Fix It
¬†
#1 You Didn‚Äôt Tailor Your Resume
Recruiters and hiring managers do keyword searches to figure out if a candidate has the experience and expertise they are seeking in a candidate. 
¬†
Review the job description, find the most important or frequent used words/phrases and implement them into your resume. (Do Not Overdo It!)
¬†
#2 You Didn‚Äôt Quantify Your Successors
Instead of saying you are great at you job, show it. 
¬†
Avoid cliches, utilize action verbs and show metrics and results
¬†
#3 Oversaturated Market
Create meaningful and personal connections through networking. A reference won‚Äôt get you the job, but it will get you in the door.

Micromanagement in the workplace is the worst thing that you can do to a team. 

If you did not know, then please understand; micromanagement shows a lack of freedom, trust, and better yet lack of respect for your employee‚Äôs skillset. 

If you are not empowering your team to go above and beyond their capabilities, then you need to part ways with this nonsense of a toxic leadership style because it cripples your employee‚Äôs and teams‚Äô success. 

If you want to destroy team culture, then keep it up (sarcasm) but you are considered not the right leader for this team because you will be looked upon as the villain. 

Here are a few tips to fix ASAP: 
1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Articulate expectations AND support your team
2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Empower your employee‚Äôs
3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Focus on feedback and not playing the blame game
4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Create a culture of innovation

Q1 and Q2 has been by far the busiest, yet highly anticipated time of the year for both my clients and I. 

In the matter of just 18 weeks, I have been able to assist 100+ clients in various areas of their careers. Whether it be career coaching, growth and development, promotions, or securing interviews, and multiple job offers with well-known companies such as Meta, Google, CBS, Amazon, EA Sports, Private & Public Government Sectors, and many more. 

Client compensation ranges from $65K to $185K, with an average of $85K being secured by a phenomenal group of professionals alongside with relocation packages, sign-on bonuses, annual bonuses, etc. 

The biggest impact has not come from me supporting them in their career endeavors but more importantly each and every one of them putting their best foot forward to articulate and showcase their talents, skillsets, major contributions, and successes which has landed them mind blowing opportunities.

The time dedicated to each of them and challenging them to think beyond the surface is what brings smiles to my face. Every phone call, text message, and DM I receive with great news -- I am always more excited than they are! LOL. 

We are all capable to achieve what we desire as long as we see the value that we bring.

üî• A Professional Summary Not an Objective üî•
 
Objectives are irrelevant in today‚Äôs resumes and if you‚Äôre still using one, stop, do not pass go, and do not collect $200. Your objective is to find a job, but your professional summary should resonate like the preview to the main feature in the movies. Enticing and alluring. 

Creating a professional summary about you includes some of your key character traits with additional keywords that match the job description. Attract the reader with some of your biggest and proudest moments in your career that make the reader want to continue reading on and continue learning more. 

Avoid using dull, repetitive, and overused language that fails to provide examples in your resume. Instead of referring to yourself as ‚Äúresults-driven,‚Äù don‚Äôt cut corners on the proof of those results you drove. 

A resume without numbers is going to fall short of the proof necessary. Be prepared to back up your professional summary with the necessary examples in your professional experience section beyond just your job responsibilities.
 
üí• EXTRA EXTRA: When trying to quantify results in your resume, begin to think of your skills in measurement format. If you cut costs, by how much, and how did you do this?

That was the advice a friend gave me when I was stuck in an unworkable situation.

It was supposed to be a breakthrough role for me with a big increase in pay.

But the team‚Äôs problems were endless. The engineering team supporting us was toxic and bullying.

The data infrastructure was a crumbling dessicated husk.

The company was operationally inept (I lost database access for 2 weeks over a straightforward issue because IT was so understaffed it took them 3 days to respond to any of my messages).

I wanted it to work, but most of the problems were political or completely beyond the scope of my role to fix.

So I left.

3 out of the 4 members of the team did the same within a month of my departure.

Hard work is no guarantee of success. Espousing hard work feels wise, and like it‚Äôs something you can control.

You have less control over where you focus your efforts, but some of us have some. 

Where you focus is the fulcrum of your hard work lever, and it‚Äôs a virtuous cycle:

The more experience you get at moving the fulcrum to where it will have maximum impact, the more freedom you get to direct your efforts 

At the same time, acknowledge that how much we can move the fulcrum is not something we have much control over, especially in the early stages of our lives, and to practice empathy for those who do not have the same freedom.

How do you direct your focus for maximum effect on the life you want?

In the early 80s, one of their engineers built a prototype of a digital camera.

He even used Moore‚Äôs law to predict when they would become commercially viable, and he was right.

In the mid-90s Kodak started selling digital cameras.

In the late 90s, they built a consumer website for users to upload photos, years before photo sharing online.

They predicted and built the future, so why didn‚Äôt they capture the value?

Their core business involved printing photos, and all of their executives came from the photo-printing side of the business.

Their photo website was built around people ordering prints, not sharing them, because their executives wanted to sell more prints.

They couldn‚Äôt conceive of alternate distribution.

A partial is a way of pinning some of the parameters of a function call so that you don't have to repeatedly enter the same args and kwargs when you make multiple function calls. 

I learned about them a year ago, but only started using them recently because honestly, they baffled me.

Some of that challenge is that many of the examples were incredibly esoteric and highly focused on solving abstract mathematical problems.

I have put together an example of building a Pydantic model using partials to silo logic in a single place.

Notice how you can still pass other parameters to the partial function. You can also override previously passed parameters to the partial.

What purpose does teaching people to write serve?,"Why do we write? What purpose does teaching people to write serve?

With the rise of large language models, these are pressing questions.

I write this from the perspective of someone who had a fantastic education in writing from a very young age.

If you think writing is to produce a document, get a certain grade, or another outcome, it‚Äôs easy to believe that large language models will replace writing.

However, if you focus on writing as a process:

It helps you craft arguments.
It helps you explore ideas.
It helps you explore thoughts and feelings.
It helps you think.

Writing teaches you to create media, even if it is only for yourself.

This is easy to miss because I think most people are not taught to write in this way; for them it‚Äôs a mechanistic process to produce an outcome.

Are there other ways to teach these skills?
Probably.

But having chatgpt write a good poem about the girl you‚Äôre crushing on in high-school isn‚Äôt doing the same thing as writing a bad poem for her.

The panic around large language models in schools isn‚Äôt really a panic around the models, it‚Äôs a panic about how out of sync our educational system is with what it needs to do.

This isn‚Äôt a new problem, but the gap is increasingly stark.

How do you think education should change over the next decade?

If you‚Äôve heard of the Maginot line, you know it as a byword for ineffectual defense.

The Maginot line was an impregnable series of fortifications on the French German border built in the interwar years.

Contrary to popular belief, it did exactly what it was supposed to do, which was force the Germans to attack France through the Low Countries, and anchor the French right flank.

This is because opposite the Maginot line was the equally impressive Siegfried line, and for political reasons the French couldn‚Äôt attack the Germans through the Low Countries.

Forcing the Germans to attack through Belgium meant the Germans had to fight the surprisingly large Belgian army. 

The French plan called for defeating the initial German invasion in the field and then counterattacking through the Low Countries where they could be seen as liberating them.

The plan faltered when the French lost the battle in the field (for reasons related to other myths around WW2).

As data workers, we should always look deeper then the popular analysis, often the real story is much more interesting.

Consensus narratives are built through politics, not data, but we should always look beyond them to see what the data bears out.

I was in the final stage, thesis, but for a variety of reasons; some my fault, some beyond my control, my thesis fell apart.

My options were:
1. Do a major revision of my thesis
2. Switch to the capstone track
3. Drop out

It was an overwhelming decision, and I needed to make it relatively quickly.

After panicking for about a day, I realized that I didn‚Äôt have to make one large decision, I could make a couple of small decisions.

The decision that had to be made quickly was whether to revise my thesis, or quit doing thesis.

The decision to switch to capstone or drop out could be made in a few weeks.

I quit thesis. I was burned out, my passion for my topic was long dead, and I knew I didn‚Äôt have it in me.

I had been working on it over a year and tied up in its collapse were feelings of guilt and failure.

A week later I decided to switch to capstone.

Having a week to recover from the emotional blow gave me more clarity about what I wanted.

The clinching argument was, ‚Äúif graduating Harvard was easy, more people would.‚Äù

(I know there is a lot more nuance to Ivy League admissions, and graduation rates, but that‚Äôs the argument that persuaded me)

I have made a lot of bad decisions, and a few years ago I decided to study how to make better ones.

My biggest takeaways were that you should make the smallest decisions that are possible in a given situation, and if you can, break large decisions up into several smaller ones.

The reason that works is that decisions are often made in stressful situations, and that stress degrades our decision making ability.

Small decisions that mitigate the stress lead to better decisions later in the process.

How do you make better decisions?

Never wanting to miss an opportunity to be smug and self-righteous, here is my definitive guide to being a productive adult:

1. However much water you‚Äôre drinking, it isn‚Äôt enough. Take your current water intake, double it, then double it again, then triple it! If you can make it through your work day without a catheter can you even call yourself an adult?

2. You HAVE to have multiple income streams. The sketchier these are the better. They shouldn‚Äôt generate value but should really be a series of rent extractions. Remember, you don‚Äôt have friends, you have customers.

3. Part of being an adult is realizing that every relationship you have is monetizable. If you have children, you need to teach them the value of hard work by billing them for your time. My son is three and a half and he already owes me one-hundred-and-eighty thousand dollars. With interest, he can pay me off by the time he‚Äôs seventy.

4. Cancel your Netflix subscription. In addition to saving a completely trivial amount of money every month, you can much more productively spend your time judging other people on social media for spending their time watching Netflix and having the audacity to enjoy their lives.

5. Exercise: every real adult knows that if you haven‚Äôt run an ultramarathon by the time the sun comes up, you‚Äôre just letting your body wither away to dust.

6. Wake up early. Do you know how much you can do if you wake up at 2 AM every day? You can get that ultramarathon in for starters. And you‚Äôll be so sleep deprived that your pathetic co-workers will have to do your work, demonstrating your management potential by delegating.

7. Take cold showers. Why should you have a pleasurable hot shower when you can turn your daily ablutions into an exercise in misery and self discipline?

Thank you for reading the definitive guide to adulthood on LinkedIn.

Humans are prone to mistakes. Rather then writing a ton of complicated logic in pandas, we can use a Pydantic data model to validate data.

We can even process it so we keep the good rows, reject the bad rows, and then return the bad rows to our users so they can correct the error.

We can even use enums to only allow specific string values to be allowed.

The following is a relatively simple way to achieve this.

The function compares every row in the spreadsheet to the data model, and returns the valid rows as a list of dictionaries.

If it fails validation, it adds the index of the problematic row to the row dictionary, as well as any error messages associated with the validation failure.

note: one area to improve the code would be to accept the index offset as a parameter instead of hard coding it.

You can then process valid rows, and return failed rows back to users for correction and resubmission.

What other validation techniques would you like me to cover in the future?

Sample data from contexture.

By around 1500, only about 5% of England's land was covered in Forest. For a premodern society, it meant almost all of the fuel for cooking and heating was gone.

So instead they turned to coal, which isn't as easy to access as firewood and charcoal but does burn much hotter.

By around 1700, all of the easy to mine coal had been used up, which meant sending mine shafts down below the water table, which meant those shafts flooded.

Because the demand for coal was so large, and because coal is incredibly cheap at a coal mine, because transportation costs were zero, it meant that building inefficient steam engines to pump water out of the mines made economic sense.

So the steam engine, which later became THE general purpose technology of the industrial revolution started as a specific technology to pump water out of a coal mine.

The circumstances unique to coal mining meant it was worth building inefficient machines that could then be improved upon, and it took about 20 years to make the machines efficient enough that they could be used for other purposes.

This is a common pattern in technology.

What other general purpose technologies started as specific purpose ones?

-Igor Sikorsky

Every weekend I take my son to the Museum of Flight so he can burn off some energy and see planes.

This quote by one of the pioneers of rotary aircraft (Helicopters) captures one of the inherent tensions in innovation.

Often we think of innovation as zero-sum, as Sikorsky's friend did. He could only conceive of aviation success in the context of fixed-wing aircraft, but couldn't conceive of complimentary uses.

For example, if you're out to sea and you boat capsizes, a plane can survey much more area and find you more easily then any other kind of vehicle, but it cannot rescue you.

A helicopter cannot search as wide an area, but it can rescue you, and do so much faster then a boat. In this context, the helicopter, the plane and the boat all compliment each other (The plane can find, the helicopter can rescue, the boat can serve as a platform for the helicopter and have more advanced medical facilities.

Innovation is not necessarily zero-sum and thinking about success and failure without thinking about complimentary functions is incredibly limiting.

I see a lot of this in the discourse around large language models and ML in general.

I should also add that innovation is not necessarily complimentary for everybody, I'd be very nervous if I was in marketing creative right now.

Why do you think so many people adopt a zero-sum view of innovation?

The handful of data scientists worked in academia or at really large tech companies. 

Data engineers functionally didn‚Äôt exist, neither did ML engineers at any meaningful scale.

This goes a long way towards explaining why Python became the dominant scripting language in the data space.

Going from a workforce of effectively 0 to a workforce in the millions in less then a decade requires a few specific traits in a scripting language.

1. Easy to learn: I took a Udemy course starting in a December, and by the end of the following February I had my first code in production (less then 3 months). My son had just been born and learning Python was a very part time effort for me.

2. Robust community: Python had a large and growing developer community and had 3rd party modules to do many things the standard library couldn‚Äôt.

3. Rapid development time. One of the big trade offs Python makes is performance for development time. Python let‚Äôs relatively junior devs develop programs faster. And this is key for data work because the demand for data ingestion is huge and building pipelines in different languages is more time consuming.

I‚Äôm fairly certain that those development time constraints shrink as devs gain more experience. But the demand for any kind of dev in data work is so huge that speeding up the time to production for junior devs is crucial to keeping pace with the needs of the business.

As the data field rapidly ramped up, there just weren‚Äôt that many programming languages that met these criteria.

As a shots fired opinion, if JavaScript had been as developed a decade ago as it was now it would probably be the dominant language in data because it‚Äôs closed a lot of that gap in the last 10 years.

Python has a lot of constraints, and it‚Äôs very easy to focus on those, but as a solution to a cold-start problem it is quite a good one.

What reasons did I miss explaining Python‚Äôs popularity in data?

I say this as someone who codes in Pandas virtually every day.

Data River: A long stream of data, usually arising in the uplands and flowing to the data sea. Can be fed by smaller data rivers called data tributaries. Can also be fed in the spring by runoff from the seasonal melting of data glaciers.

Data Glacier: Usually a beautifully built database from 1986. Has all of the most important data in it, but is slow. No one is willing to touch it because all of the logic that feeds it is written in COBOL.

Account settings and table settings determine how far in the past you can go but it's a great feature if you need to recover data in a pinch.

The syntax is very similar to a normal query.

SELECT 
ID,
COLUMN_A,
COLUMN_B

FROM SAMPLE_DATABASE.SAMPLE_SCHEMA.SAMPLE_TABLE AT (OFFSET => -5 *60) 

WHERE COLUMN_A ILIKE '%sample%'

 OFFSET is done by seconds so if you need to recover data from five minutes ago, that tells it to go back -5 * 60 seconds.

You can also specify a timestamp instead:
FROM SAMPLE_DATABASE.SAMPLE_SCHEMA.SAMPLE_TABLE AT (TIMESTAMP =>  '2023-01-01 01:01:01.011'::TIMESTAMP)

The key to making the timestamp work is the explicit casting of the string to a timestamp

To mark the glorious revolution Sales insists on changing all of their table references in the database from:

'OPERATIONS.SALESDATA.'

to:

'SALES.SALES_DATA.'

Now us lowly data engineers, who were made grand promises by the revolutionary leadership but betrayed when we were no longer needed, have to change where all the references to those tables are in our SQL queries. 

Like any good lazy engineer we decide to write a python script to do this for us.

Historically I would have done something like this:

og_db_name = 'OPERATIONS.SALESDATA.'

new_db_name = 'SALES.SALES_DATA.'

def new_db_func(query: str):
    return query.replace(og_db_name, new_db_name)

print(new_db_func('OPERATIONS.SALESDATA.CUSTOMERS'))
>>> 'SALES.SALES_DATA.CUSTOMERS'

However, I recently discovered that you could instead do this:

from operator import methodcaller

new_db = methodcaller('replace', og_db_name, new_db_name)

print(new_db('OPERATIONS.SALESDATA.CUSTOMERS'))
>>> 'SALES.SALES_DATA.CUSTOMERS'

Which version do you prefer, and why?
(I benchmarked them and there wasn't a meaningful performance difference between them)

There was nothing technically wrong with the implementation, but this was the sample query that produced the data:

CREATE TABLE gods_table (
¬†Greek varchar(255),
¬†Roman varchar(255),
¬†Egyptian varchar(255),
¬†Hindu varchar(255)
);

INSERT INTO gods_table (Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Hindu) VALUES

¬†('Hades', 'Vesta', 'Thoth', 'Kali'),
¬†('Hephaestus', 'Juno', 'Sekhmet', 'Durga');

Allegedly this is an interview question, and but I would take the interviewer to task about the table design.

This table's rows aren't meaningful.

In any properly structured table, a row should stand for a single record.

But in the structure of this table, the rows don't mean anything.

You don't need to unpivot this data, you need to fix how this data is sourced.

One of the challenges I've found is a lot of people discuss syntax on SQL queries, but completely neglect more fundamental principles like how data should be organized.

What principles of database design do you think more people need to know?

Most workplaces are hierarchical, with natural divisions in them.

Most people‚Äôs work networks involve lots of interactions within a team and a department and relatively few cross-functional connections.

Some people, however, have much stronger connections outside of the typical borders in the hierarchy, these people form a natural bridge between the various siloes in an organization, and tend to accrue disproportionate informal power.

They have more proverbial water cooler moments then their more siloed counterparts, because they end up at more watercooolers.

They also get more opportunities for special projects because people know them and know they have more cross-silo visibility.

They can also get more done for less because they can leverage more resources out of the department.

It can be especially valuable for engineers because they can gain more awareness of what other teams are working on so they can avoid duplicative work.

What do you do to build cross-silo relationships?

That was one of the mantras of the National Theater Institute of which I am an alum.

Limitations come in many forms. They can be resources, ‚Äúproduce this play for 500 dollars.‚Äù

They can be time, ‚ÄúThis report needs to be ready for the CEO in 2 hours!‚Äù

But it can also be related to skills and inclination.

An example from my own life is I have a visceral aversion to front-end work.

But because most business users won‚Äôt use a CLI, I need to get creative with my use of APIs.

Piggybacking off of someone else‚Äôs interface has a few advantages, especially when building internally facing apps.

1. Less time spent on front end work. Essentially you‚Äôre using the other service‚Äôs front end as an abstraction, letting you focus on the business logic.

2. Identifying other capacities in the API, which lets you solve problems for business users that you wouldn‚Äôt have before.

3. It integrates better into internal workflows. Rather then adopting a new tool, users get to stick to a familiar one.

Recently I‚Äôve been working with the Asana API which I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised by.

Google has another fantastic API and let‚Äôs you get inputs from Google Sheets and Google Forms.

What limitations have you recently had to overcome?

Since the bubble burst in 2000 it has never gone back that high.

It‚Äôs a profitable company, with a confirmed product market fit, and multiple revenue streams (their IT consulting business is massive).

If you bought at the trough and held to today, the return would be about 9% per annum, which basically tracks the S&P 500, for an alpha of approximately 0.

I bring this up because we‚Äôre currently experiencing a massive market correction, and real companies with product market fit, and great products, like Tesla, Amazon, and Google may not recover their share price to the peak valuations from a year ago.

This isn‚Äôt a prediction, I have no idea what their share prices will do, but more a meditation on markets.

There is no market law that good companies with good products return insane share price growth.

In fact, it is probably desirable that mature stable businesses have relatively stable share prices.

During that demi-year I am only allowed to study subjects on the curriculum.

Early in my career I took a more scattershot approach and easily got distracted by all of the tech and all of the skills to master.

Setting the curriculum is a forcing function for me to keep laser like focus, and other things I want to study I keep in a list to consider for future curriculums.

It also means that if something makes it onto the curriculum it's been there for a long time.

I've always been forward looking and have never evaluated how I did sticking to the curriculum and what the results were?

In June, I set the curriculum to focus on web technologies in Python, and I would call it a successful effort.

Having known essentially nothing on the Subject at the end of June, I have now taken the course Internet Programming in Python from UW Professional & Continuing Education, and TA'ed the course.

The primary focus was Flask and Django.

Completing a course is only a partial measure of success, and I also deployed my first web app to prod at my company shortly before the winter holiday, and it is now in user acceptance testing. That was built with Fast API, but what I learned in the course was transferable.

In the new year, I'll be building out a few more web apps to improve automations in our department and going forward this will be a core part of my work, so I'd describe this as an unqualified success.

I famously avoid front-end work, to the point where I will always use an API to piggy-back onto someone else's front end if I need to build an interface for a program.

But I recently discovered the HTMX library which is technically Javascript, but it lets you build dynamic web-pages by embedding tags in HTML and lets you define most of the front-end logic in the backend, and render it server-side.

That means you can do much more dynamic work with traditional backend languages like Python through Jinja2 templates.

""50% off of your next 1 ride (max $8.00 / ride) is deceptive, grammatically awkward, and cheap in all the wrong ways.

Let's start with ""50% off (max $8.00). I can't remember taking a rideshare in Seattle that cost less then $16.00. Basically it's an $8.00 coupon disguised as 50% off, which it resolutely isn't.

Tell me this is a badly written procedurally generated campaign without telling me this is a badly written procedurally generated campaign:  ""your next 1 ride."" Now I used to do a bit of this for a living, and including the 1 in the copy is just awful.

""Your next ride."" reads so much better then ""your next 1 ride.""

There are two options for what happened here:
1. The sentence isn't ""your next 1 rides"" so the logic already exists to handle singular vs plural and they just did a terrible job leaving in the digit.
2. Everyone got an offer of 1 and they did a terrible job copy-editing it.

Neither are a good look. Either they've let me know other people got a more generous offer, or they don't have copy editing on your email list. 

Oh, and the fine print gives an incredibly short window for redemption (5 days from when I got the email).

I couldn‚Äôt return it, so instead, several times a week I dress up like a dinosaur named Daddysaur and play with my son.

Fatherhood has been an amazing journey, and one that has made me both more grown up and childish at the same time (it‚Äôs been close to 30 years since I‚Äôve dressed up like a dinosaur).

In fall of 2021, I went into the office for a week, and to my son, my most impressive trait was that I went on a bus.

He doesn‚Äôt care what I do at work, he cares that I dress up as a dinosaur to play with him.

So this Christmas, I am unbelievably grateful to my son, for keeping me young, and reminding me what‚Äôs important.

What keeps you young?

Merry Christmas!

In my last year of college, I studied at their semester long intensive.

It was challenging. Classes and workshops ran from 6:30 AM to 9:00 PM Monday-Saturday.

Sundays they let us sleep in, so we only worked from 9:00 - 9:00.

We had 4 days off all Semester.

It was a lifechanging experience, and I met so many of my friends there.

The other thing they taught me is ""Creativity comes from limitations.""

I was working on debugging a failing schema in a database. It turns out there was an upstream job that was failing managed by another team.

I asked them to look into it and the only answer they had was to throw more cluster resources at it, which unfortunately didn't work.

I often think if as a field we get less creative the more computational power is available to us.

So today I want to extend my gratitude to the NTI to me for teaching me how to flex my creative muscles, even if I'm taking them in a different direction then intended.

Have you seen limitations fuel your own creativity?

I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong, in the best way possible.

I can confidently say that the program turned me from an analyst who thrashed out bad pandas code into an engineer who thrashed out mediocre Python code üòâ.

This led me to look at user experience design.

Originally I was looking at masters programs. I found a couple of online programs but I was leery of the price.

They were all in the 40k-50k range, to study a field I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd like. 

I also didn‚Äôt know how employable I‚Äôd be afterwards; having a masters degree and no experience didn‚Äôt seem like a great way to manage a career transition.

Luckily a random neuron fired in my head and I thought to see if any local community colleges had a UX program. That way, I could see if I liked it without shelling out 40 grand.


The Tombolo Institute at Bellevue College  had a program which was about 4000 dollars, roughly 10% the cost of a masters.

And it was really good that I did that instead because it turns out I didn‚Äôt like a lot of UX work.

It‚Äôs where I discovered my allergy to front end work.

I do love design thinking and many of the processes of UX, and it still saturates my approach to data.

Discovering that you don‚Äôt want to do something is as valuable as discovering what you love.

Part of that program was a course in digital marketing analytics, which launched my data career.

I got my first job in data (and tech) before I graduated.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve had a better ROI on my education.

This is my long-winded way of saying how grateful I am to the Tombolo Institute at Bellevue College and Bellevue College Continuing Education.

They really did set me up for a career which has brought me so much joy.

The best way to stand out as a data jockey is not data, but mentoring.

Helping other people develop technical skills is an easy way to add a ton of value to an organization.

It doesn‚Äôt even have to be other data people.

Helping PMs, managers, and others grow their abilities has incredible impact both for the org and for your own career, and even if you‚Äôre relatively junior in your career your excel and SQL skills are probably better then non-technical ICs and managers.

Mentoring and teaching has a few effects:

1. It forces you to really know your stuff.

2. It demonstrates to management that you help other people grow. In any reasonably healthy culture this is seen as a good thing.

3. It builds a network of advocates, and if you‚Äôre helping people outside of your team, it builds them across the company or department.

That network of advocates is especially useful when it comes time for promotions. Having a variety of people sing your praises to your manager helps them advocate for you. 

It also doesn‚Äôt have to be super deep in the weeds.

Here are some topics I‚Äôve taught to PMs at my company:

Cloud computing basics: Not how to do cloud computing, but what it‚Äôs for and what the basic services are on AWS.

Practical statistics for outlier detection: z-scores, and normality.

The structure and organization of dimensionally modeled databases: what dimension, fact, and bridge tables do.

Engineers were technically labor, but generous equity packages led to high-wages and wealth accumulation; one of the last bastions of plentiful and growing good jobs in an economy reorienting around the service and finance sectors.

I think the investor class has finally turned on IT professionals.

It‚Äôs seen in the letter TCI (a large institutional investor) sent to Google complaining they‚Äôre overpaying workers.

I don‚Äôt know if this gambit will work, or if it will undermine the current tech giants leading to a more competitive marketplace for IT workers.

Will IT/Software Engineering still be defined by high wages and good working conditions in 10 years?

When I originally looked to transition into tech, I wanted to enter UX.

Initially I looked at masters programs, but I was leery of spending 50 thousand dollars on a field I didn‚Äôt know much about.

In a random flash of insight I checked to see if any local community colleges taught UX, and as fate would have it, 1 had a program from their school of continuing education.

It cost 4 thousand dollars (much less then a masters degree), and introduced me to data.

I didn‚Äôt love UX work, but I loved data, so getting that masters would have been a miserable waste of money.

Seattle also had an abundance of data related jobs, which made my transition into tech relatively easy.

As I progressed in data, I found I wanted to become an engineer, and that‚Äôs how I found the University of Washington‚Äôs School of Professional and Continuing Education, who offer a plethora of classes to help people grow their tech career. 

For all that the internet is supposed to flatten geography, where we live is one of the most important factors when determining our opportunities.

The reason I‚Äôm grateful to Seattle (and Bellevue, and the state of Washington) is the schools I‚Äôve studied tech in are all public, and I love leveraging public resources.

What about your community are you grateful for?

Innovation can build tools that can be applied to social problems, but social problems are fundamentally political.

Political in the sense that it requires coordinating collective action.

Crypto is the perfect example of when you try to solve a social problem with technology and without politics.

Crypto arose after 2008 out of the sense that there was something deeply wrong with the financial industry (I don‚Äôt disagree with this sentiment).

The idea was a distributed ledger and decentralized systems would democratize finance and take power away from the finance class.

Looking at crypto through this lens, the last 5 years have been an abject failure.

Enormous centralization with the main use case for it being crime.

The technology is cool, but it didn‚Äôt solve the rapacious greed of the finance industry; it gave them one more tool to exploit.

Technology and innovation is easy. You just need a few smart people and they can make something (getting it adopted is a bit more challenging).

Politics is HARD!

Which is why the technology class wants to focus on innovation.

What are other examples of innovation without politics failing to produce social change?

Or the counter factual, what are some examples of innovation without politics succeeding at producing social change?

If 10 million people make the same ‚Äúpoor decision‚Äù there is context you don‚Äôt understand.

Across social media I see this theme that no-one wants to work in trades anymore and ‚Äúlazy millennials and/or gen-Z‚Äù don‚Äôt want to work real jobs.

Here‚Äôs the thing, most of those jobs are skilled labor and require extensive training/education to do. You can‚Äôt just walk up to the job site and get a job as an electrician.

I have a friend who‚Äôs a skilled machinist. He has made parts that go into space. 

He‚Äôs been doing it for about a decade, and he‚Äôs still paying off the loans from his training program. He makes somewhere around 18-20 dollars an hour.

The reason he isn‚Äôt doing better is because Boeing intentionally moved a lot of the jobs to southern states with worse labor protection and lower wages, which sent machinist wages down across the entire region.

The best thing to happen to him financially is that friends from his parents‚Äô church let him live in their basement inexchange for odd jobs around the house.

A friend of mine‚Äôs dad worked at a tarmac factory outside Palm Springs in the early 80s. He would work all night at the factory and then spent his mornings building a house for his wife and son. That job couldn‚Äôt get him a mortgage for the land anymore, let alone the building materials.

I also know a guy who is a general contractor and he does quite well. His main job is home renovations, and he boosts his income by flipping houses with his friends who are also contractors.

To do this, they work a full day as contractors, and then spend their evenings and weekends on the house they‚Äôre flipping, working 70-80 hour weeks. 

Back when I used to treat pain for a living, my core patient base were contractors over 40 living in chronic pain.

These are not easy jobs to have, they are skilled labor, most people who have them are underpaid.

If there are lots of open jobs that no one is willing to take, my first suggestion is to identify why that is.

Odds are you‚Äôll find that they aren‚Äôt very good jobs, for a variety of reasons, but pay is one of them.

People haven‚Äôt changed much, if they have the opportunity to build a life, they will.

So many people are insensitive to recruiters and they think that we are the ones that make the final decision. 

AS A RECRUITER, I DON‚ÄôT MAKE THE HIRING DECISION. The HIRING MANAGER makes the hiring decision. 

As a recruiter, I AM responsible for the candidate process and making sure YOU as a candidate are having good a good process regardless of if you are hired or not. (I can‚Äôt speak for all recruiters but this is how I think and operate. 

As a recruiter, I am looking for the best candidate for the role. This candidate could be a referral, connection from Linkedin, applied to the role, or I may even have to source for them. I don‚Äôt discriminate when it comes to how I find talent. I believe in a fair and equitable hiring process. If I present a referral to a hiring manager, I always try to present a few people that have applied to the role as well because referrals aren‚Äôt always the best candidates. 

As a recruiter, I don‚Äôt believe in wasting people‚Äôs time. I‚Äôm very transparent when it comes to the process and also leave a line of communication always open between my candidate and me. I try to get feedback from my hiring manager partner as soon as possible so my candidate is waiting to hear back from us. Sometimes I don‚Äôt have all of the answers. Sometimes I have no update on the role and in my eyes, that‚Äôs an update. 

As a recruiter during these times, I don‚Äôt believe in cold-calling candidates if I am not working on any roles. Time is precious. It‚Äôs also mentally draining when you are talking to 15-20 people a week and they are telling you their life story and how badly they need a job at that moment you aren‚Äôt working on any roles.

Lastly, as a recruiter, my goal is to figure out bigger ways to make an impact in the #jobseeker community rather than just having individual 1:1‚Äôs. I use this platform to educate others on the recruiting process and give out free tips and tricks to hopefully enhance people‚Äôs job searches.  

This is what it means to be a recruiter to me.

Depression and anxiety aren't just things that ""go away"". It takes time and it's a process. 

A lot of people ask me how am I so comfortable talking about my mental health on a professional platform and honestly it's life. We talk about everything else in our lives why not talk about how we are doing mentally and emotionally? 

I didn't grow up in a household where we talked about our feelings or emotions. Now that I'm older and I'm going to therapy I'm learning how to better communicate when I'm not okay in my personal and professional life. I learned to listen to myself and my body when I need time off instead of working through my problems. 

I will no longer silently struggle. My mental, physical, spiritual, and emotional health comes before anything. If these things aren't aligned I know I won't perform well at work. I'm no longer afraid to tell my people leaders that I need time off. I need time to reset. I need time to feel how I'm feeling. These things don't make me less of an employee or less capable of doing my job. 

 I'm thankful that I work for a company that is understanding and supportive when it comes to taking care of yourself. 

We often look at mental health illnesses as a sign of weakness and instead it should be looked at as a sign that we are humans with emotions. I wish having conversations about mental health in the workplace was normalized and taken more seriously.

Trying to work and live a ""normal"" life while battling depression is even more trash. When people ask you what can they do to help you, you don't have the answer because you are trying to figure that out yourself. 

My mom recently told me that ""The version of YOU that people create in THEIR mind is not YOUR responsibility.""

People have been reaching out to me with so many amazing oppurtunities to be a speaker for events, sit on a panels for their company, be guest on podcast episodes, ect. And little do they know that I am falling a part and battling things in my life. Dealing with emotions I can't explain. 

Give the strong people out there grace. Give the people that show up every day a break because sometimes they may not have the energy or capacity to show up like they usually do.  Everybody is battling something. Some people just know how to hide it better than others.

Just because someone ""looks okay"" doesn't always mean that they are okay. This week, I let my people leader know that I needed the rest of the week off due to my mental health struggling. They asked me no questions and told me to take as much time as I needed. After hearing that, I felt like a brick was lifted off of my chest. I didn't want to be considered weak or a failure because I was taking time away. 

I remember when there was a time I was afraid to take off for my mental health because I knew I may not come back to a job or I would be judged. I wish more employers saw their employees as people and not numbers. 

Employers listen to your employees when they say something is wrong and they need some time off. 

I pray for everyone that is struggling with their mental health during these times. You are not alone and we will get through this storm. üñ§

Let's talk about AAVE language. 

I'm lowkey finna give y'all a history lesson. 

AAVE, also known as African American Vernacular English, African American Language (AAL), Black English or Ebonics, is a style of English often spoken in Black American households. AAVE serves as communication among people in the black culture. The language was created by enslaved Black people living in the South who were separated from their native countries. Examples of AAVE: ""On fleek,‚Äù ‚ÄúAF‚Äù, ‚Äúsavage,‚Äù ‚Äúshade‚Äù, ‚Äúsip/spill the tea‚Äù, ""lit"", and ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, ""no cap/cap"", ""sis"", ""bruh"", etc. 

Oh, and did y'all know that AAVE usually has a negative connotation in a white-centric culture and is looked at as ""bad grammar"", ""ghetto"", or ""uneducated"". This is why many of us blacks know how to code-switch so well. We code-switch between AAVE, standard English, and ""CJ"" which is corporate jargon üòÖ.

I see a lot of non-black creators on this platform nowadays using certain slang on their post and it's ""cool"" or ""trendy"". But if I were to use the same words in the same context people would say that I'm being ""unprofessional"" or better yet ""this isn't the platform that I'm supposed to be talking like that on."" There is a lack of accountability that has enabled people to participate in digital Blackface.

BLACK CULTURE IS NOT A TREND. üó£Ô∏è
MY BLACKNESS IS NOT A TREND. üó£Ô∏è
AND WE CAN'T TEACH ABOUT OUR CULTURE IN ONE MONTH!!! üó£Ô∏è

I go to bed and wake up like this everyday. I don't get to pick when I want to turn my blackness on and off. Our culture is getting elimanted in schools. Our culture gets disrespected on a daily basis. 

People love our culture but don't love us. Make it make sense. We are never just appreciated for being us. 

Using Black speech for online clout or personality while condemning that same speech in Black people is not only problematic in the digital world, but in the real world, too. 

So to my lovely non-black friends, next time you decided to use the term ""lit"" or ""woke"" in your posts remember the history and meaning behind where it came from. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

That's all.
Thank you for coming to my history lesson. ‚úäüèæüñ§

Can we talk about referrals?

A lot of you all ask me for a referral or if you can use my name as a referral. If I don't know you and we've never spoken my answer is going to be no. 

Why? 

Because I can't vouch for you. And if you say or do some off-the-wall stuff in an interview that's going to make me look bad. I have a brand that I have built at my job and I just don't let everyone use my name on their application. 

Also, just because someone refers you to a position doesn't mean that you will automatically just be sent over to the hiring manager. I still look at every referral's resume that I receive and if their background and skillset are aligned with the role that's when I will have an initial conversation with them. 

I know nowadays and especially in this job market people rely heavily on getting a referral from someone in their network. Networking and building connections are the keys to getting a referral.

Ask to grab virtual coffee with someone if their schedule permits. 

Make sure that the conversation doesn't feel like a transaction and more so like 2 people getting to know each other.  

Be intentional about who you connect with. 

& lastly, don't take it personally if you reach out to someone and they don't reply. You never know what someone is going through. 

Best of luck to my jobseeker friends on this snowy Tuesday. ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Let‚Äôs talk about this. 

If you are submitting the same exact resume to 400+ jobs that is a problem unless every job has the same job description and your resume mirrors that job description. 

If you are applying to all types of roles in different industries with the same resume, that could also be why you aren‚Äôt getting any responses back from your application.

I‚Äôm going to give you all some #recruitertea. The job description comes from the hiring manager. Everywhere I have worked the hiring manager creates the job description. So with that being said, look at the job description as a cheat sheet. Tailoring your resume to that job description can make you stand out from other candidates. 

By tailoring your resume, I don‚Äôt mean copying and pasting the job description to your resume because you will get rejected. Look at your skillset and experience and see how it is relevant to what the job requirements are, or if you‚Äôve done the work in some capacity and share those examples. If you are able to use stats or numbers in those examples that‚Äôs even better. 

I hope this helps someone. I‚Äôve always been told that if what you have been doing isn‚Äôt working then it‚Äôs time to change some things up. If what you have been doing when it comes to applying to jobs hasn‚Äôt been getting you noticed, try something else.

The whole world has come together and agreed that these men that just so happen to be all black deserve whatever is coming to them. They need to be under the jail for a very long time. We all have agreed that these men should be punished.

All of that is beautiful and I'm glad that we all agree that if you kill someone that is innocent or beat someone to death they should be punished. 

But where was that energy and unity when it came to Derek Chauvin - the man who had his knee on George Floyd's neck?

Where was that energy when those 3 men killed Ahmaud Arbery? 

Where was this energy with Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile, and all the other blacks that were murdered from police brutality? In all of these cases white people don't perceive themselves as aggressive or a threat. In these cases, all of these cops were in fear of their lives. 

These black men have been charged. Fired from their jobs. No paid leave. Nobody is trying to say that these men were ""scared for their lives"", change the story around, or give them the benefit of the doubt BECAUSE THEY DON'T DESERVE IT. THEY DESERVE TO GO TO JAIL. 

& I know someone is going to bring up black-on-black crime in the comments and I don't want to hear it. There are so many programs, organizations, non-profits, etc that are out there to help the black and brown community stay out of trouble and help them get on track to doing better. 

We live in a society where the law and the system were created for white people. Let's just call it how it is. But we can't be mad at a system that was never created to support or protect us. This is exactly what I mean when I say if you don't see my color, then you don't see me. 

I see all these people saying that color isn't a factor and if that's the case then I need the system to take action and be as swift as they were charging these black cops when a white cop commits police brutality. 

We are tired. 

That's all I have to say about that.

& LinkedIn is probably going to shadow-ban my post. That seems to happen when I start talking about things that make others feel uncomfortable. üòí",2231,,0,üòí,1,,0,,,Text,,,,,,,,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7025831506929455104,0,58,771,0,0,2/20/2023 20:45

Like...

Can we make it a thing to not have meetings on Fridays? If it can wait until Monday, let's let it wait. 

Can we also make it a thing to not schedule meetings back-to-back on people's calendars unless the meeting is urgent? And if it is urgent can we try to add a 10-minute buffer in between the meeting just so if they are like me they have time to use the restroom, fill up their water bottle, and get their life together. 

Oh, and can we also normalize sending people a message before we throw time on their calendar so people can know what the meeting is about?  

Lastly, if it can be sent in an email or through messenger and doesn't require a meeting please send it on there.

I'm learning how to receive constructive feedback and not shut down. 

I'm learning how to delegate and allow people to help me with certain things instead of doing everything on my own.

I'm learning how to give myself grace.

I'm learning that timing is everything and just because it doesn't happen on my time doesn't mean that it's not going to happen at all. 

I'm learning how to lead and project manage.

I'm learning how to say no to meetings and reschedule them if I need to.

I'm learning how to better manage my time and set boundaries. 

I'm learning how to listen and understand instead of listening to just hear. (Yes, there's a difference.)

Last but not least I'm learning to think and sit on things before I react. 

This season is the season of learning, changing, and growing.

Today I have done SQL Project based on Zomato dataset in Collaboration with my brother Balaji A . We explored the Zomato dataset using SQL and below are the analysis we did.
                üéØ ZOMATO SQL PROJECT üéØ

Project Objective :
¬† ‚û°Ô∏è The project involved analyzing customer behavior on the Zomato platform, which is a food delivery, sales, and customer.¬†
¬†‚û°Ô∏è The data used for the analysis was about Zomato sales based on membership, which contained information about sales, customers, products and membership.
 
Provided Task :
¬†‚û°Ô∏è The task was to use SQL queries to answer several questions about customer behavior on Zomato.¬†
¬†‚û°Ô∏è The sample questions included: what is the total amount each customer spent on Zomato, how many days has each customer visited Zomato, what was the first product purchased by each customer, what is the most purchased item on the menu, which item was most popular for each customer, and which item was purchased first by a customer after they became a member. 

Project Approach :
¬†¬†‚û°Ô∏è We approached the project first and had to clean the data to ensure that it was in a usable format.¬†
¬†¬†‚û°Ô∏è Checked any missing values and dealing with any data quality issues.¬†
¬†¬†‚û°Ô∏è Then used SQL queries to extract the data from the Zomato dataset and performed aggregate calculations on the data to answer the questions.

Analysis Report :
  ‚û°Ô∏è The result of the analysis showed that the most popular products on Zomato were product1 and product3.¬†
¬†¬†¬†‚û°Ô∏è As based on the customer membership the Zomato points for user 1 and user 2 earned the Zomato points and the highest points earned as per product was p3 is 3045 points.¬†
   ‚û°Ô∏è These are insights helped to provide a better understanding of customer behavior on Zomato and will be useful for making informed decisions.

As an introvert, I‚Äôve realized from hundreds of coffee chats over the past year that having small talk with strangers absolutely wiped out my social battery. So much so that I would often have to take a nap afterward.

When I was job searching, I was requesting and having coffee chats almost everyday. But even when I was done with job searching, and as my LinkedIn following started to grow, I started to be on the receiving end of coffee chat requests.

At first, I was all too happy to help anyone and everyone I could. I knew what it was like to be a career-changing job-seeker, so I gave my time and energy out to almost anyone who wanted to learn about how I did it.

But it came at my own detriment. It was not just the time spent in the coffee chats, but also the anxiety I had leading into the call and the refocusing that I struggled to do immediately after the call, that piled up, especially when it got to the point where I was saying yes to 2-3 coffee chats per day‚Ä¶ultimately leading to burnout.

However, coffee chats themselves were not the real reason I ended up burning out. But rather, it was my inability to set boundaries and protect my own time that led me to a point of ignoring almost every DM and coffee chat from LinkedIn over the past 2 months.

I have written in depth about how coffee chats and networking are the entire reason I am where I am today, and I stand by that. To all the wonderful people I have met through coffee chats over the past year or so, I‚Äôm so thankful for every single one of those conversations.

But to everyone else I have yet to meet, please have patience with me as I act a bit selfishly for the time being in my process of learning how to value myself and my own time.

Last weekend I flew across the country to referee a powerlifting competition, and Stephen Tran happened to be competing at the very same meet (this was not planned at all)!

For those who don‚Äôt know, the sport of powerlifting plays a huge part in both of our lives, but Stephen and I would not have found that shared interest if LinkedIn had not brought us together in the first place.

LinkedIn can get a bad rap as a platform for only networking or schmoozing, but in reality it‚Äôs a place that can bring together people from all walks of life who share the same passions.

","Before I became a data scientist, I worked in the consulting world, and I hated it. 

Coming out of business school, it seemed like investment banking or consulting were the only two acceptable career paths. So when I landed my first post-grad job as a financial consultant, I thought I had ‚Äúmade it.‚Äù

But behind the promised perks of frequent traveling and expensed meals were long nights, tracking billed hours down to the minute, catering to every client request, and lack of ownership over my work product due to being an external consultant. 

When I was making the transition to data science, I kept wishing I came from a more relevant background, and almost resented my time in consulting. What was building powerpoint presentation decks all day good for?

But during one of my previous data science interviews, my interviewer said ‚ÄúWe were interested in you not just for your technical skills, but for the consulting soft skills you bring too.‚Äù

Then when I made the jump to individual contributor at a tech startup, I was too eager to dive into internal work and internal work only. However, the reality was that 50% or more of my current job is handling customer requests and acting as a data consultant of sorts, rather than the 100% heads-down work I had hoped and dreamed for.

I now realize that providing a product or service to customers is not unique to consulting. Prioritizing a client or customer‚Äôs needs is necessary for any successful business, and apparently I had been underestimating this transferable skill because I was so caught up in leaving consulting.

In any career transition, you bring your own unique strengths. Don‚Äôt forget them in the process of gaining new ones because those strengths are what has gotten you to where you are today.

Even before recording week, I had spent countless nights in the months leading up to it writing scripts on a subject that I admittedly had to do a lot of research for, since it had been years since I worked in finance

Thankfully throughout the process, I had the amazing support of my producer Adam Slomiak and content manager Jennifer Brady to guide me through all the times I wanted to give up and call it quits (and trust me, there were many such moments)

To them, and to everyone who has hyped my courses up in the past few months, I am so so thankful üôè

Many of you followed me behind the scenes in the making of this LinkedIn Learning course SQL for Finance, and I‚Äôm so excited for you all to see what Jennifer Brady , Adam Slomiak and I have been working hard to create

SQL for Finance blends together my experiences as a former financial analyst, data analyst and now a data scientist to bring to you a course that‚Äôs perfect for any professional working with financial data

Back when I was working as a financial analyst in mergers and acquisition advisory, it was Excel all day everyday, and I know that is the case for many finance professionals to this day.

But as I‚Äôve spoken to more and more people from similar finance/data backgrounds as mine, I‚Äôve learned that the finance industry‚Äôs growing demand for data-driven decision making will inevitably cause a growing demand for professionals who know SQL

Whether you are financial analyst working with data or a data analyst working in the finance industry, be sure to check out this course!

As a matter of fact, it coincided with how often I was using LinkedIn. For a period of time, I viewed every post, connection and conversation I made transactionally‚Äìfrom the lens of ‚Äúhow can I use this to achieve my goal of landing my dream job?‚Äù

Outside of LinkedIn, I was sacrificing personal relationships and the quality of my life to balance working my full time job, studying, side projects and coffee chats, and justified all of it by calling it ‚Äúa passion.‚Äù

Buying into hustle culture felt great for a while, until it no longer did. Coming out of a 5-year relationship recently was the catalyst that made me reevaluate what made me truly happy (getting really personal here), and it turns out, constantly hustling to chase moving goal posts was not it.

A lot of people checked in to see if I was doing ok during my break from LinkedIn recently (which I appreciate SO much), but honestly, I was having a WONDERFUL time being lazy, shopping, hanging out with friends, re-prioritizing my health, and just being a regular 26-year-old again!

Contrary to what you often see on LinkedIn, you DON‚ÄôT have to chase your goals 24/7 to be successful.

There is certainly a time and place for putting your blinders on and hustling, but what this recent break has taught me is that giving yourself breaks and finding happiness in other facets of life is how you stay successful.

Over the years, I‚Äôve been no stranger to the sinking feeling in your stomach when you hear someone got a better grade, was accepted to a more prestigious school, landed a higher paying job or promotion, or has more followers than you, etc.

Every time, I really thought I could gain an upper hand in the game by using my jealous anger as fuel to do better than the other person‚Äìstudy harder, work longer hours, write better posts, just do MORE.

For a while, it worked. The pressure I put on myself to ‚Äúwin‚Äù in this game I was playing against my unknowing competitor became such a driving force in my life, and I did manage to reach plenty of the goals I had ruthlessly set out to achieve.

But in the process of those blind pursuits, I was losing sight of the fact that I was getting so burnt out and resentful‚Äîmeanwhile my competition was most likely still thriving.

Seeing that the other person still ends up winning, no matter how much I compared myself to them or resented their success, was what made me realize comparison is a futile, zero-sum game.

On social media platforms like LinkedIn, it‚Äôs so easy to compare ourselves to people who seem to be winning. But in that process, we lose sight of our own wins that probably many others would kill for.

While there is immense focus on laws of physics, Pythagoras theorem, etc., concepts such as Savings, Investments, Compounding, and Loan/ Debt are equally important, if not more.

Kids also absorb the important concepts such as Profit, Loss, ROI, Growth, Percentages, etc., well when applied practically rather than learning formulas.

My biggest observation when my kid started investing in stocks(not directly) was that he was relating consumer goods, product launches, and macros with a potential impact on the share price. When Mahindra launched a series of successful products from 2020-22 ( Thar, Xuv700, and others), he could correlate share price movement with the bookings and waiting periods. Mahindra grew from Rs 300 to Rs 1300 per share in this timeframe.

His next question was, ""Can I buy Mcdonald's share."" His understanding may not be perfect, but he is asking the right questions, and the learning is at near zero risk at his age. (He just turned 11). 

Next, I taught him how banks work. Once he understood the concept, his immediate question was, banks give us 5% interest but lend at 8%. That's 3 percent profit. I learnt this when I was 20 or 21.

Encouraging kids to learn investing is gaining popularity in the west with concepts such as Custodial accounts. 

Most Indian Parents feel that educating kids about money, investments & stock market will take their focus away from studies. But it is also true that an average Indian who starts earning at the age of 20-21 spends at least 3-4 years before they start understanding even simple investment instruments such as PPF, VPF, and associated tax benefits. Stepping into stock markets (direct, mutual, or index funds) happens in the early 30s for most Indians.

Indian Parents teach kids to study and work hard to earn more. There needs to be more focus on how to smartly save & invest that money so that it can grow. 

Awareness about saving money and growing it by investing can go far in teaching children to become responsible adults. Kids will make mistakes early on, but risks will be less as investment amounts will be smaller. The same learning coming with a 10X investment corpus 10 years later can hurt more. 

All I want to say is, ""Get your kids started with Savings, Investments, and Stocks.""

Here‚Äôs how you can do that:

1) Open a Junio or FamPay account

2) Give them access to a stock market simulator. Once they understand how things work, buy some stocks on their behalf and ask them to track price movements and build a point of view (right or wrong doesn‚Äôt matter).

3) Get them to save money, invest it and see what return they get in 6 months or an year. 

Let‚Äôs bring change.

PS: Here is a snapshot of my kid's investment diary.

You‚Äôre a student in a Stanford entrepreneurship class. 

You have $5 in funding. 

Your goal is to make as much money as possible within 2 hours and then give a 3-minute presentation.

What would you do to maximize the return? ü§î

I recently read how Stanford students turned $5 into $650 in 2 hours and thought to share my learnings. 

.
.
.

First, let‚Äôs talk about the typical, logical path: buy materials for a makeshift car wash or a lemonade stand, buy a lottery ticket, or gamble. 

With this approach, you can probably turn $5 ‚Üí $8.¬†
The ROI is minimum. 

.

Second, let‚Äôs take a look at the smarter group. 

They realized that the $5 was mostly a distraction, so they focused on making the most money in 2 hours. 

They ended up making reservations at popular local restaurants and then selling the reservation times to those who wanted to skip the wait.

The ROI? A few hundred bucks. 

. 

Now, let‚Äôs look at the winning team. 

They didn‚Äôt just realize that the $5 was mostly a distraction.

They also realized that the 2-hour period was also a distraction, and that the most valuable resource was the 3-minute presentation time they had with a group of captivated Stanford students. 

So they sold their 3-minute slot to a company interested in recruiting Stanfrod students for $650. 

The ROI? 12,900%.

I am an angel investor in two BFSI companies and really admire what Navi Technologies is doing.

Sachin Bansal, who had laid out the blueprint for a $100 billion plan for Flipkart, set up his venture BAC Acquisitions (later renamed Navi Technologies) in December 2018, immediately after exiting Flipkart.

Bansal‚Äôs diversified portfolio includes companies like Unacademy, Inshorts, Ather Energy, and OLA (to name a few).

And what about Navi? Interestingly, after Flipkart, Bansal has invested in 18 companies personally and through BAC Acquisitions. He has investments close to $1Bn, with a major chunk in Navi.

Navi was primarily set up for investments and acquisitions in the BFSI sector but also includes other sectors.

It has made 7 investments (with one exit) so far that include - 

- $30 million in Infra Market.
- INR 500 million in Kissht.
- INR 200 million in boAt.
- INR 100 million in Bounce.
- INR 1 billion in KrazyBee.
- And $4 million in Bounce.

Apart from investment, Navi itself has raised a total of $582 million in funding from 14 investors.

But what's that Bansal is more fascinated about, and how is he using Navi?

Bansal aims to leverage tech to change the face of the old BFSI giant. So far, banks have yet to cater to consumers at the level at which NBFCs and payment apps do. People rarely use apps from their Banks. Bansal wants to change that through intuitive customer service and an automation-led experience. He might be right to a large extent.

However, technology alone can't fix all the BFSI issues. YES BANK was among the first to offer UPI payments and entered API banking, facilitating the issuance of a commercial paper (CP) of INR 100 Cr using blockchain technology for Vedanta. The bank was at the forefront of tech adoption yet faced an RBI moratorium because of mismanagement. But I am expecting Navi to adapt to this positively.

Not a promotional post but sharing something that should have your attention. Navi aims to bring change to the BFSI sector and I‚Äôm eagerly looking forward to it.

I'll talk more about product and business on LinkedIn. Follow Vaibhav Goel for more such content on Product and Business.

Join me in this hands-on article as we explore the intricacies of OLS by analyzing the effects of select economic indicators on the growth of high and upper-middle income countries. Using data from the World Bank and the statsmodels package, we'll delve into the topic and gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between these indicators and economic growth.

","I have been fascinated by the brain and the complexity of behavior for a while now. This semester, I finally got an opportunity to delve deeper into these topics with neuro-economist Dr. Paul Zak's class on Behavioral Neuroscience. Basically, neuro distilled for economists. 

In our recent discussions and assignments, we've explored the fascinating topic of morality and the influence of evolution on our perceptions of fairness. It got me thinking. How has our sense of fairness evolved, that is, how does it work today? How is it related to our perception of corruption? Is there a threshold below which corrupt activity is tolerated? What incentives are driving this? Cultural evolution is much faster than natural evolution; have our brains updated on time to deal with complex societies? In this brief article, I provide an evolutionary argument for why our fairness mechanism remains crucial for humans, and I question our collective ability to take action against corruption in the face of rising levels of populism and social unrest worldwide.

I hope you find the piece intriguing at the very least. If you enjoyed it, consider subscribing or sharing it with your friends! And if you have any feedback, please do reach out or leave a comment.

This article will give you an idea of how chatGPT, Tesla's AI, and chess-champion AlphaGo reason and adapt by interacting with their environments. It also pins down a common misconception: Data is not everything. There are events for which it is very complicated, borderline impossible, to even generate training data. Thus, limiting the kinds of questions we can ask. Reinforcement learning provides an alternative learning strategy based on heuristics that may prove to be a useful complement to the Causal AI framework brewing right now.

From self-driving cars to voice-activated personal assistants,
AI is already changing the way we live and work.

But what does the future hold for this powerful technology?
Artificial intelligence (AI) is shaping the future of the accounting industry with these advantages:

üëâ With the help of AI-powered tools, accountants can automate repetitive tasks, such as data entry and financial statement preparation, allowing them to focus on more strategic tasks. 

üëâ AI-based systems can help detect fraud and improve investment decisions.

üëâ AI can assist in analyzing large amounts of data to provide insights into financial performance and potential areas for improvement.

As AI technology continues to advance, it has the potential to revolutionize the accounting industry and make it more efficient and effective.

While the future of AI is exciting, it is not without its challenges.
One of the main concerns is the potential for AI to displace jobs and create economic inequality.

Additionally, there are concerns about the ethical implications of AI, such as the potential for bias and the need for transparency and accountability.

Overall, the future of AI is one of enormous potential and promise. As we continue to develop and refine this technology, we must be mindful of the potential challenges and work to ensure that its benefits are shared by all.

They require a different approach to management, a different mindset, and a different set of skills.

So, if you're thinking about starting a business or are already on the startup journey, embrace the differences and embrace the challenge.

Financial forecasting and budgeting can be a daunting task.

But with the right strategy and tools, you can ensure success in managing your business‚Äô finances.

Here are five tips for creating successful financial forecasts and budgets:

1. Start with a clear goal in mind: Before you start building your forecast or budget, have a clearly defined goal in mind that will guide the rest of the process.

2. Utilize reliable data sources: Make sure you‚Äôre using up-to-date, accurate data when forecasting and budgeting.

3. Track historical patterns: Take note of how your business has performed in the past and use it as a benchmark or guideline for future projections.

4. Analyze potential market changes: It‚Äôs important to consider possible changes in the market that could affect your financial situation ‚Äì both positively and negatively ‚Äì when forecasting and budgeting.

5. Stay organized: Utilize effective systems that allow you to store and easily access all financial information related to your forecast or budget. Doing so will streamline the process and help avoid errors.

This is a difficult time for workers and businesses alike, and it's important for companies to explore all available options to support their workforce.

One way for tech companies to support their employees and encourage research and development is by taking advantage of the R&D Tax Credit.

This tax credit provides a financial incentive for businesses to invest in R&D, allowing them to maintain their workforce and continue to drive innovation.

In addition, the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) is another option for companies to consider.

The ERTC provides a tax credit of up to $7,000 per employee, per quarter, to eligible employers who retain their employees and continue to pay them during the pandemic.

If you're a tech business owner, I encourage you to learn more about the R&D Tax Credit and ERTC, and how they could benefit your company and your employees.

By utilizing these resources, we can work together to support the job market and drive a strong recovery from the pandemic.

You can message me to learn more about these tax credits.

Digital identity is becoming increasingly fluid, reflecting a major shift in the way people identify online. 3 points:","I just spoke in Dubai on the re-emergence of Pseudonymity. Digital identity is becoming increasingly fluid, reflecting a major shift in the way people identify online. 3 points:


1. There are three ‚Äòtypes‚Äô of pseudonyms:

PUBLIC: Public pseudonyms are easily tied to their human author. The author makes minimal effort to distance their identity from their pseudonym. In the case of digital creators, this is a modern way to start a brand. Think: meme page owners, digital artists, selfie-sharing Redditors, YouTubers, etc ‚Äî e.g. Mr. Beast or Dream. 

NON-PUBLIC: Non-public pseudonyms are only tied to their human author in private, known only by very few people or platforms. Think: When a phone #, email, or legal ID is required to register for a service and the pseudonymous user makes no effort to create a burner or use a VPN (KYC). They just don‚Äôt necessarily want to be publicly known, for whatever reason ‚Äî e.g. celebrity artist Marshmello‚Äôs human identity was a closely held secret until 2017. 

UNLINKABLE: Unlinkable pseudonyms have no or near-no connection to their human author. Unlinkable pseudonyms are a powerful device for private expression, yet equally as powerful for malicious actors. While this category is regarded as a problem area for pseudonymity, it also represents a significant opportunity and defined by ‚Äúhow you use it‚Äù ‚Äî e.g. Satoshi Nakamoto, the famed pseudonym who created Bitcoin. 



2. Digital pseudonymity has evolved over the years, spanning multi-user domains, bulletin board systems, internet-relay chat, AOL, forums, blogs, MMORPGs, social networks like Reddit, cryptocurrency, and more. Pseudonymity lost focus with the introduction of Facebook, Google, and other human identity obsessed revenue models, however it‚Äôs now majorly coming back into focus.



3. A new pseudonymity boom can be attributed to the rise of avatars, virtual reality, anime, gaming, and a need for privacy. There are many trending use cases for pseudonymity, including:

‚Ä¢ NFT profile pictures
‚Ä¢ Digital pen-names
‚Ä¢ Pseudonymous apps
‚Ä¢ Artificial assistant developers
‚Ä¢ VR creators (e.g. PHIA)
‚Ä¢ Virtual influencers
‚Ä¢ 2D VTubers
‚Ä¢ PNGTubers
‚Ä¢ AR filter influencers
‚Ä¢ 3D VTubers



While pseudonymity is a powerful mechanism, its uses are double-edged‚Ä¶ for good and for bad. 

However, the vast majority of pseudonyms are Public or Non-Public. People mainly use them casually, often for self-expression or content lurking ends, with varying levels of care for privacy and a general subscription to accountability.

Overall, pseudonyms are a highly personal, dynamic device for digital privacy, expression, acceptance, security, and free speech. 

Pseudonyms are the outcome of society‚Äôs increasing need for an online presence that represents dynamic interests in varied mediums.

My departure is certainly not ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù to anyone I‚Äôve met along the way. Instead, this is ‚ÄúHello‚Äù to everyone who has supported me thus far and to all the people I will meet during my entrepreneurial career. This is ‚ÄúHello‚Äù to exploring value creation in new problem areas, independently.

Ultimately, this is a necessary step in my entrepreneurial journey to recalibrate my best efforts with my best interests.

I am passionate about creativity, community, privacy, and open access. I love building new technology, experiences, aggregators, and digital identities. I am keen on ephemerality, artificial intelligence, fandom, and incentives. I look forward to sharing my insights on all of these subjects, and more.

I will now take stock, reflect, read, write, and soon proceed with a fresh, focused perspective towards solving human problems in new, creative ways.

Thank you to my mentors, investors, and friends for the continued support as I venture into what‚Äôs next.

The most humbling takeaway came from a conversation I had with Michael Ferraro, before we stepped onto the panel:

Michael, an Animated Film Industry veteran and executive at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told me many stories from his career cultivating the computer graphics industry.

Leaning on his experiences founding and growing Blue Sky Studios in the 1980s, he emphasized that what's old is new when it comes to the metaverse.

Almost every modern idea about ""the metaverse"", from game worlds to virtual fashion to avatar storytelling, provably parlays 3+ decades of studios, ideas, execution, failures, and exits. 

It's true‚Äîthe metaverse is a rebranding of the old and tried.

That being said, there's a trove to be learned by researching the played-out models from the recent past.

The future potential is also much easier to grasp when you consider the metaverse in this way, in that yesterday's models and mechanisms may have new relevance tomorrow.

Expedite your perspective by speaking with people who already walked your path years ago.

Ignoring the past will prevent you from anticipating the future.

I had the rare opportunity to interview virtual human Lu‚Äôs manager, Pedro Alvim üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà, to peek behind the scenes of this high-impact, virtual operation.

""Building influence is complex and not easy. The focus must be on storytelling, diversity and bravery. We need characters that represent ourselves and our beliefs, and don‚Äôt be silenced about what happens in our real¬†world,"" Pedro Alvim üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà said during our conversation.

""The fact you create or have a character doesn‚Äôt mean you have an influencer, with an engaged community. Influence is built, not created.""

Lu lives on the app icon, in customer emails, on the navbar, in commercials, in the rewards program, and, most importantly, posting daily on social media from a 1st person point of view.

Like a coat of paint, she‚Äôs all over.

She's what the Amazon smile would be if given two eyes, a name (Alexa?), and an active social media presence.

She's the GEICO Gecko on steroids and a pristine example to anyone looking to invent or re-invent their identity online in a timeless, interoperable, engaging way.

On Twitch, the VTuber category has grown 500% YoY for 3 years. To win these animated creators, YouTube put this exploding industry on their top bar for the day:

""The secret to being authentic online may just involve being radically artificial."" -YouTube‚Äôs official trends podcast

A VTuber is when someone puppeteers an animated character in real-time, most often by using free, off-the-shelf webcam technology.

VTubers dominantly livestream on Twitch and YouTube, with some using dedicated VTuber apps, such as Reality app, to express themselves. 

With skyrocketing fandoms, YouTube recognizes the massive opportunity to serve and earn the trust of this burgeoning lofi medium.

What do VTubers do, exactly? 

During a VTuber livestream, expect to watch an animated character play video games, react to funny videos, chat with their fans, record ASMR, sing karaoke, browse websites like Reddit, and even appear alongside other VTubers.

Who subscribes to VTubers? 

Weebs, otakus, and anime lovers (primarily Gen-Z introverts) who develop long-term parasocial relationships with the human creators embodying pseudonymous anime characters.

How do VTubers make money? 

VTubers make a living from financially-committed fans in some of the following ways: Subscriptions, donations, tips, merch, sponsorships, and even hosting live concerts.

That's right... some VTubers take their fame beyond livestreaming, parlaying their influential IP into music careers as exemplified by the likes of Mori Calliope, Nyanners, Gawr Gura, Kizuna Ai, and others.

If you manage talent, run an animation-related business, run a gaming company, have a brand mascot, are a creator looking to break out pseudonymously‚Äîyou need to increase your exposure to the VTuber space.




Are you up to speed with VTuber culture? Have you played Needy Streamer Overload yet? Are you looking for a waifu? Look no further than the VTuber industry.

On the internet, your identity is what you make it.

That's how it's been since the start, no matter what scrap-booking website Facebook tried to convince you about online identity in the early 2000s.

IRC, Forums, AIM, Xanga, MMOGs, Reddit, Tumblr, Yik Yak

Twitter is a modern sanctuary for pseudonymity. 

Entire pseudonymous communities burgeon on the platform, from NFT pfps to VTubers, all expressing themselves right alongside human identities‚Äîon an equal playing field.

Pseudonymity is the solution to many problems.

In a world that needs online privacy, data protection, digital expression, and freedom of speech, pseudonymity is necessary.

Any platform, tool, or company who facilitates pseudonymous expression will go far over the next decade‚Äîand Twitter is one of those platforms.

Ian Hubert: lnkd.in/ez7uHuKP. Animation is permeating culture and turning the heads of Hollywood, investors, and streaming sites alike:

During the pandemic, love for animation spread within the film, television, social media, gaming, and livestreaming industries, manifesting in the form of virtual production, anime, virtual influencers, metaverse, and VTubing respectively.

Facing a recession, Hollywood executives and streaming services cut back on programming after years of unfettered growth, now optimizing for lowered production costs and investing more into virtual production (LED volumes) to achieve more with less.

Further, ongoing consumer, platform, and investor interests have aligned in a recent shift away from mid-budget films (2 hours in length) and instead towards either binge-worthy shows (10+ hours) or big-name blockbusters ($100M+ budget).

As a result, Hollywood now dabbles in virtual productions like The Mandalorian, Stark Trek: Strange New Worlds, Netflix's 1899, and more to answer to these widescale, high-stakes shifts.

However, virtual production has it's place‚Äîits a midpoint on the medium spectrum between two familiar endpoints: ""animated"" and ""live action""

It's crucial to realize that the virtual production dot on this medium spectrum has an arrow pointing FROM ""live action"" and TOWARDS ""animated"" ...not the other way around.

In other words, virtual production's existence is a solution to live action and an admittance to the value of virtualization (animation).

This arrow tells the full story of where incentives originate, where budgets flow, and what Hollywood's future holds.

That future is virtual.

Affordable, accessible, animated storytelling for the masses. The death of live action. The pressure of short-form, exploded. The Creator Economy, matured.

The Hollywood regime, threatened.

A margin of profitability onset by obsessed technical artists realizing more efficient means of animated media production using real-time game engines from batcave-like bedrooms.

In the case of this 1-minute action sequence, legendary VFX artist Ian Hubert leveraged Blender to combine traditional keyframing, physics simulation, and Rokoko motion capture data... on his own.

There's your cocktail‚Äîand your proof.

Sets, cameras, lenses, lights, and more will someday be replaced by assets, bridges, engines, blueprints, viewports, and creative technologists like Ian ""shooting"" on computers with actors motion-captured‚ÄîWITHOUT dots all over their bodies.

ON THE VTUBER INDUSTRY

1. Cartoons, anime characters, and digital pets are taking over Twitch as ""virtual streamers"" or ""VTubers""‚Äîwithout revealing their faces or names.

2. VTuber derives from ‚Äúvirtual YouTuber‚Äù‚Äîsuch people use avatars or images to portray themselves online while keeping their offline identities mostly hidden.

3. Popular in Asia for some years, VTubing has only recently gained traction in the U.S.

4. Viewership for the VTubing category on Twitch has more than quadrupled from January to August of this year compared with the same time frame last year, says Twitch.

5. Full-time VTubers make money from Twitch (donations/subs), merchandise sales, brand sponsorships, and YouTube clips (+ more methods on more channels).


ON ""WHY BE FAMOUS AND ANONYMOUS?""

6. VTubers say they can have a big online presence without the unpleasant side effects.

7. Some people have disabilities or chronic illnesses that prevent them from always looking or feeling camera-ready. VTubing can provide income for people with disabilities, since it doesn‚Äôt require people to physically look or act a certain way.

8. Some streamers say avatars help them preserve mental well-being.

9. Some people didn‚Äôt find an audience streaming as themselves, or found being on-camera tiring. 

10. Some people choose to stay incognito to avoid the harassment or negativity that many popular creators face.

Why would I waste so much of my precious 18 minutes talking about dots?
¬†
Because dots are the building blocks of #innovation, and innovation is an essential trait of a great leader.

So what are these dots? Anything and everything. Experiences. Ideas. People. Something you read. Someplace you visit. Someone you meet. Everything that comes into your world, into your awareness, is a dot. And when you connect two or more of these dots, there‚Äôs a little spark.

And that spark is called #creativity.

Now here‚Äôs the really cool part. The more of these dots you collect‚Äîthe more experiences, ideas, and people you have in your life‚Äîand the more different they are,¬†the more creative your #connections will be. That‚Äôs a really valuable attribute for a leader to have.
¬†
Because another cool thing about collecting lots of dots is that¬†when you have a lot of dots, patterns start to emerge. These patterns can help you see things the competition can‚Äôt see. That makes sense, doesn‚Äôt it? If you have a dot that your competitor doesn‚Äôt have, then that competitor can‚Äôt possibly make the same connection you can.
¬†
There‚Äôs a world-famous collection of dots in room 201 of the Art Institute of Chicago. These dots were put onto a canvas in 1884 by an artist named George Seurat. And when you take a step back to see the patterns, they form a painting called La Grande Jatte.
It‚Äôs a great painting, but it‚Äôs also a great reminder of how dots really work.
¬†
See, when you look at the dots up close, individually, they don‚Äôt seem to relate to each other. There‚Äôs a blue dot next to a yellow dot. Over there is a black dot, and a green one.
¬†
Now, again, think of the experiences, the ideas, and the people in your life as individual dots.
¬†
There‚Äôs your Uber driver, and your 12-year-old niece, and that time you got lost in Ireland, and that article you once read about why shoelaces untie themselves. Separately, these all seem entirely unrelated‚Äîand they are. But you collect enough of these dots, and all of a sudden, patterns start to reveal themselves. And ten years later your niece invents self-tying shoelaces with a built in GPS that will automatically call an Uber driver if you get lost.
¬†
As a #leader, then, you owe it to yourself, your team, and your organization to collect as many disparate dots as you can. Read voraciously. Talk to lots of people. Travel. Because you never know which obscure dot is going to be the billion-dollar answer to your million-dollar challenge.

But don‚Äôt take my word for it‚Äîbecause those aren‚Äôt my words.

They were said by Sam Altman, the CEO of the company that developed ChatGPT, just a couple of weeks ago.

Now, why on earth would a CEO say that his own product is ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù?

Because he‚Äôs not afraid of what author Anne Lamott calls the ‚Äúsh**ty first draft.‚Äù

As he said in the interview from which that quotation was taken (and I‚Äôm paraphrasing here), ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre seeing right now is not even version 1.0 of #ChatGPT. It‚Äôs more like version 0.7.‚Äù

And this, my friends, is how you do innovation in the 21st century.

Now, I‚Äôm not saying you should release a ‚Äúhorrible product.‚Äù (Particularly if your product is, say, a self-driving car, a robotic surgery device, or a commercial airliner.)

What I AM saying is that, in most cases, you don‚Äôt have to wait for perfection in order to introduce your product or service to the world. Because if that‚Äôs your threshold, you‚Äôll be eating cat food next to your beautiful‚Äîbut still ‚Äúnot quite ready‚Äù‚Äîversion 3.4 while you watch the person who released version 0.7 become a billionaire.

So go ahead‚Äîrelease your minimum viable product. Release Version ‚ÄúGood Enough for Now.‚Äù And then listen as the universe tells you how to improve it.

Over the past several weeks, I‚Äôve been putting together a program specifically designed to help credit union leaders and their teams think differently about their credit union, their members, and their industry. I‚Äôve spoken to many of you about your challenges and your opportunities.

And I have a thought I‚Äôd like to share with you today.

Historically, credit unions were built around the idea of community. Member ownership. The personal touch.

And while the huge advances in digital technology have made transactional banking more convenient, they‚Äôve done so at the expense of that personal touch that set credit unions apart. When fewer members ever even set foot into a physical CU branch, it becomes more difficult to put a human face to the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù credit union.

Kind of tough to establish and maintain a personal touch without a human face behind it, don‚Äôt you think?

So my idea, wrapped up in a question, is this: How could you incorporate video to better serve your members, and prospective members?

What if you were to create a personal 2-minute video each week giving a financial‚Äîor even non-financial‚Äîtip or message to your community?

No razzle-dazzle. No flashy graphics. No bombastic music. Just you, talking to your community? Creating a connection.

The personal touch.

Your mission this week, should you choose to accept it, is this. Get together with your team for 40 minutes and play with this question: What are five ways that we could use short videos, on a weekly basis, to re-establish a personal touch‚Äîa human connection‚Äîwith our community?

I have other ideas for you as well. If you‚Äôre interested, send me a direct message, and let‚Äôs chat.

That‚Äôs because I caught a cold last week, and I‚Äôve been feeling a little lethargic.

So I thought about taking a nap.

Here‚Äôs the weird part. After thinking about taking a nap, I didn‚Äôt feel any more refreshed.

So rather than just THINKING about taking a nap, I DECIDED to take a nap.

That‚Äôs right. I made a DECISION.

And here‚Äôs where it gets even weirder. Even after making a DECISION to take a nap, I still didn‚Äôt feel any more refreshed.

I know, right?

I was confused by this, and that confusion tired me out.

So I took a nap.

And you know what? I FELT MORE REFRESHED AFTERWARD!

Now, I realize that some of you might want to take this nice little story and turn it into some sort of metaphor for your own personal and professional life. You know, like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not growing the business I want, even though I‚Äôve thought about it a lot, and even decided to do something about it. What am I missing?‚Äù

If that‚Äôs what you want to do, go ahead and TAKE THAT ACTION. I can‚Äôt stop you.

Besides, I‚Äôm too busy thinking about writing a book.

When I‚Äôm not napping, I help forward-thinking leaders and their teams think differently about their business so that they can see new opportunities and possibilities. I‚Äôve got some ideas for you; message me if you‚Äôre interested.

‚Ä¢ acquiring a new tool each month‚Äîcomplete with mini-training‚Äîto help you and your team¬†think differently¬†about some aspect of your business (and life) in a way that unlocks¬†new opportunities and possibilities;

‚Ä¢ rolling up your sleeves alongside your team once each month for the¬†exclusive¬†purpose of playing ""What if...,"" ""Where could...,"" and ""How can..."";

Having said that, I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and suggest that there are not many pregnant women who could pull off a Super Bowl halftime show.

And I say THAT because I‚Äôve read a few reviews this morning that seem to think Rihanna‚Äôs performance yesterday was‚Äîand I‚Äôm going to paraphrase here‚Äî‚Äúmeh.‚Äù

As a guy who thinks a lot about thinking differently, I‚Äôm wondering: Is it time to rethink our approach to entertainment?

Look, I‚Äôm nobody‚Äôs idea of Rihanna‚Äôs target market. I‚Äôm not very familiar with her work. But what I saw yesterday was an extremely talented woman with a great voice singing very good songs.

Also, she‚Äôs pregnant.

And somehow that‚Äôs not enough.

Because, somehow, we‚Äôve gotten to a place where spectacle trumps substance.

This is also true of our approach to politics.

We vote for the most entertaining candidate, not the most qualified.

Everything is a show, and the more flamboyant, the more outrageous, the more explosive, the better.

We‚Äôre a nation in constant search of the next cocaine hit.

Maybe it‚Äôs time for a reset.

In my professional life, I help leaders and their teams think differently about their business. Now I‚Äôm suggesting that maybe we start thinking differently about entertainment as well.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†How can we decrease costs?
¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†How can we sell more widgets?

My guess is that, upon reading that, you had one of two reactions:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†I don‚Äôt believe that would really happen.
2.¬†¬†¬†¬†How do you know my CEO?

The sad truth is that the above dialog, while not universal, is not unusual.

We don‚Äôt value thinking.

Or, to put it another way, we value DOING over THINKING.

What we seem to have forgotten is that ‚Äúthinking‚Äù IS ‚Äúdoing.‚Äù

How much time do you have scheduled on your calendar next week just for thinking?

My guess‚Äîand this is just a guess, mind you‚Äîis that the answer is somewhere between zero and naught.

Peter Drucker once said, ‚ÄúTell me what you value and I might believe you. But show me your calendar and your bank statement, and I‚Äôll show you what you really value.‚Äù

Thinking is the most important skill we have. And yet we rarely practice it, and almost never schedule time for it.

Think about that.

This is where that ""LAST CHANCE!"" part comes in. Because TOMORROW I'm teaching a LIVE, 1-hour workshop called ""ThinkShift‚Ñ¢: How To Think Differently About Your Business In 2023."" (Don't be fooled by the name, though‚Äîthe techniques I'll be sharing also work for your personal life.)

In this workshop, I'll introduce you to 4 different ""frames"" through which you can see your situations (problems, challenges, opportunities) with a new perspective, which will open up new possibilities.

And it's only 97 bucks.

That's less than a cup of coffee.

Okay, it's not less than a cup of coffee. But it's less than a lot of other things. For example, it's less than a pressure washer, and I know this because I just bought a pressure washer.

Any one of the ideas I'll be talking about could move the needle in your business‚Äîor in your personal life‚Äîin a major way. And, really, isn't that worth 97 bucks?

A landing page is a standalone page that a person ""land"" on after clicking from an email, ad or other digital creation...

Got that?

Here is how I write landing page that converts for my clients...

First, Whether you're selling a digital products, a physical products, services or whatsoever

You need a landing page.

But after studying 100s of landing pages, I've noticed 93% sucks. A lot!

They're awful at

=> Connecting with the right emotion

=> Being specific

=> Saying what exactly they do etc.

But as a copywriter who's worked on series of landing pages... here is a proven framework that I always use...

1. A Headline with value

Make sure your headline has some sort of value attached to it. 

This can be anything from a specific feature about what your product does (like ""The only thing that compares to [product name] is [competing product name]"")...

To a more general benefit like 

""We'll get your money back in 6 months"" or ""You'll save $X on this purchase."" 

Just make sure whatever you write has some kind of value!

2. A more specific subheadline

Next, we want to make sure our subheadline is crystal clear about what we want the user to do next (or how they can benefit from using our product). 

A good example of this is using ‚ÄúGet started now!‚Äù ü§î over ‚ÄúTake action now!‚Äù because the latter phrase might be too vague for some users.

3.  A value based CTA. 

""Get started now, Learn more, Buy now"" are action based CTA not value based

You can make your CTA more value driven... 

For example Gumroad uses ""Start selling"" Instead of ""Get started""

4. Social proof:

Credibility backs up your promise.

People like seeing other people who have already signed up for your service or product‚Äîit makes them feel like they're part of a tribe!

A final note.

When you follow this simple but effective framework, you'd convert more visitors into buyers...

But you still need to do your research to know your auidence... 

What gives her sleepless night and how you can help her overcome the problem.

That's it. 

Hope you got value?

2. Sell what people WANT to buy... Not necessarily what they NEED to buy

Don't know the difference? Here is it...

Needs are things that are essential and are a necessity while Wants are things people will love to own or experience 

For example... food is a consumer need. However, a chicken burger is considered a consumer want, as it is not necessary in order to live.

You grab?

3. Don't be jack of all trades and try to sell everything to everyone instead be a master of ONE before investing in another.

4. The money is in the follow up: 

80% of sales are made after the 5th contact.

Be relentless at follow up but don't over do it so as not to come across as desperate.

5. You must takes the risk away from customers:

People are afraid that they'll regret buying something

So you have to take the risk away from them and put it on yours

You can do this by offering a guarantee.

6. There'll be bad days

Low sales days

Rejection days etc.

It doesn't matter that much

What do matter is how you react to them.

That's it! It's not that sexy

But you can always scale through.

I entered the year, feeling very unmotivated

Because I had a major blow in business late last year

I'd be joking if I tell you it didn't have a bad effect on me. 

But then, I realized that, the more I wallow in it 

The more the wounds get dipper.

Now here is it...

""The solution to one problem is merely the Creation of another""

It's an endless cycle.

My point is, ""don't hope for a life without problems

There's no such thing, instead hope for a life full of good problems""

Yeah, 

To be happy we need something solve

Life itself get extremely boring without problems

Happiness is therefore a form of action.

So, don't believe that there's nothing you can do to solve your problems

In fact, don't try to put the blame on somebody else

It may make you feel better but just in the short term.

Own it up, accept it, take responsibility

And find ways to solve it.

In my case that was what I did

It took me some time to figure it out

But... It's all I've got and needed.

So this new month, I want you to know that....

""Happiness is a constant work-in-progress because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress

The solution to today's problems will lay foundation to the next problems""

It's how you react to it that will determine the end result.

Be good and don't hope for a life without problems

You'll never have one.

A few years ago, when I got accepted for my HND program.

I got to class a few minutes earlier for our first lecture. 

But as soon as I entered the classroom, something caught my eye. 

It was a beautiful dark-skinned girl. 

The moment I saw her, my heart skipped a beat 

That moment I knew we were going to get along well. (Yoruba demon vibes hahaha üòÇ)

Instead of going straight up to her and trying to impress her like every other dude...

I decided to keep my cool... Younno üòÉ

I focused my attention on the class activities and regaled my friends with funny relatable stories about my ND days

My friends found my stories quite amusing, and soon enough, everyone was paying attention to me...

Including the girl... 

Her smile alone was the turning point for me. Lol

It was then that I realized something. 

If you genuinely want to win people's attention and make a good impression

Don't create your content for the purpose of winning their attention

Yes!

You just have to bring out your best self, and the rest will take care of itself. 

And that's exactly what happened here. 

I got the girl's attention without even trying, and the rest, as they say, is history.

So listen, it's not about the trends, the algorithm or whatever any bloody guru must have told you

Although they contribute 

But most times, It's about being your real self

Being entertaining and...

Forgetting about the great marketing hacks you inherited from great grandfathers.

Soon enough, they'll start to notice you.

Don't complicate it... 

Be real... It's not every time you try to model someone or do what someone is doing

Try to do yours... Your own way!

When I started, the difference between the money I want to make and the money I made was not something one could say out publicly

It was like wanting a Lamborghini Aventador and ending up with an evil possessed 2003 Toyota Camry. ü•∫ü•∫

In short, I used to make very little money

Like I used to be a content writer, a copywriter a digital marketer and whatever the F I think I can pull. Loll

I believe so much in myself.

There wasn't any difference between me and every other average marketing guy out there

But then I decided to focus only on copywriting (and I only take on specific copywriting projects)

Today, people pay me more

And some even call me the copy prodigy ü§†ü§†

Well, a client actually called me that after a FB Ad copy I wrote for him pulled in more sales than he could imagine.

Enough of the hype.

Here's the gist:

To make more money you need to pick a niche

Don't be just about everything... (Content writer, copywriter, lead gen expert, digital marketer etc.) in one bio üò≥

A lot of LinkedIn profiles are like that and it confuses the hell out of your potential clients.

According to James Clear in his book Atomic Habits:

The more you master a SPECIFIC skill

The harder it becomes for other people to compete with you

Even if you're not the most naturally gifted 

You can often win by being in a very narrow category.

My beautiful friend Jummai - The Content Mistress always rings this to my ears every time as well. ü§†ü§†

By niching down you have a good chance of winning

But only if you try.

So you can start by asking yourself

""What are the problems & goals my ideal client has?""

""What am I good at and would like to do for the rest of my life?""

The answer to this is where your niche is.

You can even take it further by being ultra specific.

Makes a lot of sense.

Here are some reasons why it feels impossible for you to make more sales 

1. Quality of Leads:

Simply put,
Poor quality leads = reduced sales
High quality leads = Increase in sales 

Poor leads are people who need your products but don't necessarily want it

While quality leads are people who want your product and have a strong desire for it.

2. Lack of trust:

I used to tell my clients,

Every buying decision is like a gamble

People are afraid that they'll regret buying something

So you need to help them better understand that buying from you is the smartest and safest option to fulfill their needs and solve their problems

You do this through testimonials and recommendations from experts.

3. You're selling the process not the solution:

Again, nobody cares about your products and services

When you open, when you close, the quality of your staff...

How long it took you to be where you are and all those craps

The only thing they care about is the possibilities your products can make for them

Instead of saying: The XYZ car delivers 55miles per gallon in the city

Say: You'll save money on gas & cut down on environmental pollution when you use our energy saving high performance hybrid car.

You get the gist right?

When you're not making as many sales as you'd like

Understanding where things are going wrong first is key!

You can send a DM to find out how I can be of help to you.

In some markets in Florida, Texas and California, the increases exceeded 20%.

Also big expense increases in turnover costs -- and that combines both a) higher costs for materials and labor plus b) more turnover... which will be an even bigger factor in 2023, and therefore a big reason to focus on resident retention (especially given the uncertain demand outlook plus the upcoming spike in supply). Simply put: Turnover is more expensive than ever. Operators are shifting into occupancy/cashflow protection mode.

And big expense gains in utilities, maintenance and payroll. Staffing and payroll remain major pain points and operational focus areas. Three years since COVID hit, operators are still struggling to hire and retain top talent. Industry leaders are working to control payroll costs through centralization -- which empowers on-site teams to do what they do best (lease units and serve residents), while automating or centralizing back-office tasks.

Marketing was lower growth for 2022, but it's increasing in recent months as operators try to stir up leasing traffic. We're also seeing a lot more focus on driving marketing efficiencies via smart digital marketing tied to leasing and pricing strategy. Market what you need -- when and where you need it.

Very few traditional malls offer true live/work/play experience, and I would bet those that do have fared better than those that offer only retail shopping and a food court. In recent years, developers have incorporated apartments into mixed-use developments featuring outdoor shopping as opposed to enclosed malls, but I don't see why apartments couldn't work in the latter if done right.

So the question now is: How do you most effectively add apartments into an existing mall to add life to it? My thought: You'd have to go big. Adding a 200-unit apartment building in a mega mall parking lot probably wouldn't do much, so you'd have to be very thoughtful about the scale/placement of apartments that would add the desired effect on mall retail.

Of course, this doesn't mean every or even most investors in these markets will be distressed. Note that most deals are longer-term holds financed long prior to 2022. This list is only signaling potential risk of distress, and barring a black swan event, distress should be more the exception than the rule -- and particularly centered around highly leveraged recent acquisitions with floating debt coming due at much higher rates than initially projected.

The top 10 list includes (not in order) the coastal giants of San Francisco and San Jose, New York, Seattle, plus Midwest markets of St. Louis, Chicago, Minneapolis, Detroit and Kansas City. 

What do you think of the list? There are a few surprises to me. Most notably, I'm optimistic on the Sun Belt overall, but I am surprised Phoenix didn't make the list. (Although Lonnie Hendry, Jr. told me that if CRE CLO loans were included, Phoenix might have been ranked.) 

St. Louis is a pretty big surprise at the top, but I was unaware that >14% of deals already have debt service coverage ratios below 1%. Kansas City was also surprising to me, though it appears KC is included only because of the big volume of 2022 deals (which likely become distressed only if investors used short-term debt).

I'm less surprised by coastal metros, as I've been making the point for years that these markets are not truly ""core"" anymore from a textbook definition -- only by the standards of old traditions. (For the record, I'm not anti-coastal, but just of the view that most would be more correctly classified as ""opportunistic."") Per Trepp, declining cashflow is becoming problematic particularly in the Bay Area.

Trepp's methodology looks at securitized Freddie Mac loans, and is weighted based on occupancy, DSCR, net cash flow, and the share of loans (of total) originated in the first nine months of 2022. Link to the full report is in the comments.

Well, if you're a cynic, you could claim operators just make up the numbers. But a clear-eyed view shows the truth: Most outside research oversimplifies the analysis. Now, to be clear, there is a real affordability challenge: We need a lot more low-income housing to keep up with demand. But this is not the same thing as the ability of current market-rate renters to pay rent (and that's why rent collections consistently measure ~96%).

There are 4 big reasons why most outside research, including one earlier this month from a leading economic data provider, show rent-to-income ratios >30% -- much higher than the low 20% range you'll see reported from publicly traded apartment and SFR REITs (as well as from RealPage and others using lease-level data).

1) Some researchers lean on an ""apples and oranges"" analysis -- meaning they'll mix private-sector rent reporting (i.e. Zillow) with government data on incomes. The problem? Private-sector data providers, like website listings, tend to be skewed toward more expensive, professionally managed rentals more likely to advertise online. Meanwhile, government data on incomes represents a much broader population. When you combine the two, it grossly inflates the rent-to-income ratio.

2) The reality is that more expensive rentals attract renters with higher incomes, which keeps the median rent-to-income ratio in the low 20% range. One reason this is missed is because it's very difficult for outside researchers (even the Census) to accurately track non-family roommate households, which represent a huge share of multifamily renters. For example, picture two 26-year-olds making $60k/year renting a new 2-bedroom apartment for $2,200/month. Individually, it'd take 44% of income to rent the unit. Together, it's 22%. This is remarkably common yet too often ignored reality of rental affordability.

3) Additionally, millions of renters receive vouchers or access to low-income housing programs that lock in the rent at ~30% of income. (Of course, these programs need to be vastly expanded as demand > supply.) This is a massive nuance that oversimplified outside analyses rarely account for.

4) Just like applying for a mortgage or an auto loan etc., nearly all property managers conduct affordability analyses (of varying types) to ensure the renter is able to pay the rent, and this helps prevent a mass unaffordability scenario.

The only accurate way to do accurate reporting on rent-to-income ratios is to look at the actual incomes and rent among the households actually renting units. Take the ratio for each household, then capture the median ratio. When you do that, you'll find the ratios are much lower than what is reported. That's what we did here.

This shows the share of home purchases by SFR portfolio size, and while large institutional investors get 99% of the attention (and blame), they represent a low single-digit share of purchases in Phoenix -- and even that was one of the hottest institutional SFR markets over the last cycle.

Rick and the team at Johns Burns Real Estate Consulting show that investors with >1,000 homes in their portfolios represented only 1.4% of home sales in Phoenix in Q4, and their share peaked around 5% previously. If you add in portfolios with 100-999 homes, you add another 1% or so. (I would exclude iBuyers simply because most of those homes are flipped back to homebuyers, not put into the long-term rental pool. And btw, also note from this chart that when you exclude iBuyers, SFR investors actually claimed a lower share of total home purchases in almost every quarter of this last cycle compared to what they did back in 2009-2012.)

That means -- which everyone who tracks SFR already knows -- that small local investors continue to dominate the single-family rental market ... not only in Phoenix, but everywhere. Investors with 9 or fewer homes continuously represent >20% of all home purchases there, according to the top-notch research team at JBREC.

Somehow small ""mom and pop"" investors slide below the media radar while the bigger shops (with a tiny fraction of market share) grab all the headlines -- and all the public/policymaker angst. I'm certainly not suggesting they deserve any blame, as SFR investors of all types provide single-family homes to renters who may not otherwise be able to buy in those neighborhoods. Both home purchase and home renting have their place, and I'm a big believer in ""both/and"" not ""either/or.""

But if you do have frustration with single-family rental investors (even if misguided), you should have 20x more angst toward ""mom and pop"" local investors than toward large institutional investors.

As a general rule of thumb: The larger the loss-to-lease, the larger the renewal increase. We saw large renewal rent hikes in 2022 as operators tried to bring renewal leases closer to market.

But much has changed since June 2022, when loss-to-lease measured 10.1%. New lease market rents cooled off in the second half of 2022, ending the year with four straight month-over-month cuts followed by a flat number in January. Meanwhile, renewals ‚Äì which are often priced 60-120 days in advance ‚Äì continued to play catch up. As a result, loss-to-lease is plunging just as fast as it soared upward.

Now the loss-to-lease discount has plunged to 3.3% as of January. That‚Äôs actually below the long-term norm of 4.5%. (It‚Äôs critical to acknowledge there is almost always some loss to lease because there‚Äôs usually a discount for renewals relative to new leases, as operators often incentivize renewals in order to reduce turnover costs, reward good residents, and protect occupancy. A widespread ‚Äúgain to lease‚Äù scenario is unlikely as we'd have what‚Äôs called ‚Äúinverted rents‚Äù ‚Äì incentivizing renters to move from one unit to another at the same apartment property.)

Here are possible implications:

1)¬†Renters renewing their leases today are doing so usually based on terms agreed to 2-3 months ago, when loss-to-lease was still above average. But renewal offer letters going out now are likely much more conservative, as property managers are intently focused right now on retention and occupancy ‚Äì especially given rising vacancy and the uncertain new-lease demand outlook. In other words: It's much harder today to backfill a vacant unit, and since there's no cashflow on a vacant unit, retention becomes even more important.

2)¬†More turnover.¬†Historically, renter turnover is higher when loss-to-lease is lower. Why? Because when turnover plunged in 2021-22, most renters saw their best deal was usually to stay put. Most were still getting sizable discounts relative to a new renter. In a low loss-to-lease scenario, that discount is much smaller ‚Äì and when renters study their options, they are more likely to see attractively priced alternatives this year than they would have in 2021-22.

3)¬†Most operators will adapt ‚Äì and even eagerly adopt ‚Äì lower-priced renewals to focus on occupancy and cashflow in 2023. But value-add investors could be in a tougher spot, particularly those with short-term investment periods facing a double whammy of below-pro forma rent trade-outs and above-pro forma interest rates. We‚Äôll see how it plays out.

More available supply + cooling rents = incentive for renter mobility/turnover to increase, and we expect that'll accelerate throughout 2023. Indeed, apartment leasing also showed signs of improvement in January, but at least a chunk of that appears to stem from musical chairs.

Recent history on retention leading to where we are now:

1) Retention rates skyrocketed during the lockdowns, briefly plunged back to normal in the second half of 2020, and then shot up again throughout 2021-2022.

2) Interestingly, renters renewed leases most frequently when rent growth was at peak levels -- as it was often cheaper to renew than relocate, plus ultra-low vacancies meant there were few attractive alternatives (in any housing type, not just apartments).

3) Front-door leasing traffic stalled out in the second half of 2022 despite strong job growth and strong income growth. Demand for all types of housing essentially froze up due to low consumer confidence. People were waiting it out, even if they were secure in jobs, and renters already in place continued to renew at high frequency.

4) The lack of front-door leasing plus growing new supply levels led to vacancy rates quickly rising from record lows in early 2022 to healthier, more normal levels a year later. That prompted four straight months of unusually large new lease rent cuts (month-over-month) and a flat rent number for January (a period where we typically see modest growth). 

5) And as a result of rising availability and cooling rents, renters now have a lot more options. Unlike in 2021 and 2022, renters facing lease renewals are seeing more attractively priced alternatives. That encourages relocations.

6) I know some folks are itching to rush to judgment that retention is dropping because of affordability challenges, but the data doesn't back that up (not yet anyway). Rent collections actually improved about 50 bps year-over-year and they're back around pre-COVID levels (in market-rate apartments). Additionally, household incomes among new lease signers (many of whom we know were relocating from other apartments) jumped 6% YoY, which was >100 bps above new lease rent growth.

Every apartment operator I talk to is laser focused on keeping current renters and luring in new renters right now. Occupancy = cashflow, and therefore protecting occupancy is critical in a time when new-lease demand is uncertain and new supply is plentiful. 

Renewal rent pricing is going to come down quickly as the gap between new-lease rents and in-place rents has shrunk remarkably quickly. There is no longer a big loss-to-lease gap.

All that means, as we've been saying for a while now, is that the balance of power in the rental market has shifted back in favor of renters.

1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Let‚Äôs dramatically expand funding for the highly successful Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to help incentivize a massive increase in need-based affordable housing construction, preservation and maintenance. This has been the most proven solution to deliver housing for low-income families, as the math just doesn‚Äôt work (costs for land, labor, materials, regulatory fees, etc.) without LIHTC.

2)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Let‚Äôs establish a Middle Income Housing Tax Credit program to incentivize housing construction and housing maintenance for the middle class ‚Äì who do not qualify for LIHTC units but also cannot typically afford rent for newly built housing.

3)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Let‚Äôs dramatically expand funding for housing vouchers to address long waiting lists across the country, and also reform the voucher program to encourage wider adoption. In Los Angeles, as one example, the city re-opened its waiting list recently for the first time in 5 years ‚Äì and was expecting 365,000 applicants for just 30,000 spots.

4)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Create incentives for cities and states that remove barriers to new housing construction ‚Äì such as reforming zoning (legalizing more apartments), pre-empting rent control (proven time and again to simply limit supply, benefitting only a few with untargeted benefits at the expense of the majority), removing red tape that adds both cost and time to new housing construction, and reforming building codes to legalize more efficient construction including modular and pre-fab housing.

5)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Let‚Äôs codify renter protections that protect renters yet encourages housing providers to maintain properties and build more supply. Protections should include rental assistance and support for those unable to pay rent, such as funded eviction diversion programs. Protections should also address fraud among both landlords and tenants, both of which ultimately limit the volume of quality available housing supply, and compliance with Fair Housing laws designed to protect renters. And programs allowing renters to build credit by paying rent.

While we typically see a small pop in rents after the calendar turns each year (and saw a sizable bump in January 2022), there was no pop in January 2023.

U.S. apartment rents held flat from December to January -- which was a mild surprise. After four consecutive month-over-month rent cuts to close out 2022, we expected that pattern to continue (even if more modestly) in January.

Still, for the more-watched year-over-year rent change, there's a big impact from replacing Jan 2022's big bump with Jan 2023's goose egg. Year-over-year asking rent growth for new leases measured 15.1% this time one year ago... and now it's at 4.99%. First time below 5% since May 2021.

Why are rents cooling off so fast? Well, it's simple supply (more of it now) and demand (less of it now). After the big demand freeze (for ALL housing types-- not just apartments) in the second half of 2022, apartment occupancy dropped to 94.8% as of January 2023. That's the lowest rate since February 2018, and it'll likely dip lower by year end. Even if demand meaningfully improves (and there are signs that IS happening), it's unlikely demand can keep pace with the 40-year high in new apartment supply scheduled to complete this year.

Of course, this doesn't mean the sky is falling. The long-term tailwinds for multifamily (and rental housing more broadly) are still very much intact. The discount to rent versus buy (entry costs for a new renter versus buyer) is higher than ever. Demographics remain favorable, and unemployment is at 50-year lows. And after big job growth last year coupled with very little housing demand, there's certainly pent-up demand out there that will be unleashed as people feel better about the economy and their place in it.

But that being said: 2023 could be a tough year, especially for Class A apartments in or near downtown neighborhoods (all across the country) competing with this big wave of new lease-ups.

And lastly: There's a persistent myth that the slowdown is concentrated in the Sun Belt. That wasn't true before, and it's still not true now. Other than weakness in the Desert region (Vegas, Phoenix, Reno), there isn't a consistent regional story playing out. In January (month-over-month), the deepest cuts came in a hodgepodge of markets: Detroit, Anaheim, San Francisco, Phoenix and Jacksonville.

But there's a problem: Financial math doesn't like the idea as much as people do. Office-to-apartment conversions -- while wonderful -- are 10,000x more buzz than reality. Per CBRE, there will be a total of just 34 such projects nationally in 2023. Just 34. That likely amounts to <1% of all apartment units currently under way.

Here's why office-to-apartment conversions are so challenging despite our love affair with them:

1) Building floorplates. Office buildings are much deeper than residential buildings. That means many buildings won't work at all, and those that do will require long, rectangular floorplans that would likely need to include window-less bedrooms. That's OK for affordability, but some cities won't even let you call a room a bedroom without a window.

2) Plumbing and mechanics. Office buildings have 1-2 bathrooms per floor. Residential buildings would need bathrooms in every unit, which requires re-plumbing the entire building -- meaning significant work through drilling through concrete flooring. Office buildings also typically have more elevators and different HVAC requirements (every unit needs individual HVAC), which means re-working building layout too.

3) Cost. Conversions are expensive. In many cases, developers will tell you it's easier/cheaper just to demolish the office building and start over from scratch. That would assume you're buying the building for essentially the cost of the land, which -- even in today's weak office market, is a big stretch. To make conversions work, developers need to score a deal on an office building way below market price. Additionally, the building must be empty in most cases -- meaning you can't assume any income during the conversion. (Also, higher building costs = higher rent.)

Of course, office-to-apartment conversions can happen -- and thankfully some do. They often work because of generous public subsidies (i.e. historic preservation tax credits or opportunity zones) and city incentives. If you think about the best office-to-apartment conversions, you'll likely be thinking about very historic, regal office buildings that had reached functional obsolescence, and the city then worked with a developer to subsidize the conversion. The good news is that there are serious efforts both at the local and the federal levels to incentivize more office-to-apartment conversions. Other regulatory clean-up work is needed around zoning and building codes.

When they do happen, office-to-apartment conversions can be super cool and beautiful projects. Count me as a fan.

But also count me skeptical with the increasingly popular idea that office-to-apartment conversions can be more than a drop-in-the-bucket plan to create supply and aid affordability.

3/ Don't expect your skills and experience to be enough. Using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method can help you structure your responses and provide specific examples to stand out from the crowd. 


4/ Use positive affirmations to pump yourself up before the interview. Tell yourself you're confident, capable, and ready to crush it. Positive self-talk is proven to work. 


5/ Good communication is a two-way street. Don't just focus on what you're going to say. Listen carefully to the interviewer's questions, and show you're engaged by nodding, asking follow-up questions, and making thoughtful responses.


6/ Practice...always. Don't just wing it on the day of the interview. Rehearse your answers to common questions, and role-play with a friend or family member. You'll be more prepared and relaxed.


You got this.

Just talked to someone who got fired after 4 weeks.

3 weeks in they were put on a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan).

1 week later they were let go.

Was it a layoff disguised as a performance issue or something else?

She was a talented individual so it didn't make sense.

I dug in to see what happened.

They received 1-day of training (if you can call it that).

Expectations weren't clear from the beginning.

And it sounds like there wasn't much interest in coaching her to success.

Red flag city. 

I also found it ironic that the manager who let her go has a LinkedIn profile littered with language like ""leader"" ""people builder"" ""inspiring greatness"" and my favorite...""be the light for others.""

The reality is:

- bad leaders are everywhere
- toxic work environments are everywhere
- people telling you one thing but then doing another are everywhere 

For anyone considering a new job, it's so important to:

- fully understand the training & onboarding process up front 
- do due diligence by talking to current & former employees before accepting any job
- ask the 'hard' questions to hiring managers during the interview process (more on this in the comments)

I wish no one has to go through this kind of experience.

3 questions you can use to identify a good or bad boss in your next interview:

1) ""Of all the people who‚Äôve worked for you, how many have been promoted and how did you help them get there?""

This can reveal a lot about how they develop and support their people.

The best managers will have specific examples of how they did this.


2) ""Can you share a time when an employee gave feedback on something that can be improved or changed?""

This can reveal how they accept and implement feedback (or not).

The best managers make people feel heard, understood, and respected when accepting feedback.


3) ""What leadership development opportunities exist here?""

This isn't just for you, but it reveals how the company is investing in its leaders.

You'll likely have multiple managers at your company so this is important to know.

You're not just choosing a job, you're also choosing a boss.

Choose wisely.

That's how many people from our layoff list landed a new role.

With thousands more in interviews. 

My team spent the last month collecting this data.

Not a small number.

But pales in comparison to the tens of thousands that lost their jobs.

We can do better and will.

Our list still has at least 6,000 people actively looking for work (and growing each week).

Talent all across the board - engineering, product, design, sales, marketing, ops, HR, recruiting, and more. 

So today we're officially relaunching our layoff list and rebranding it to just ""The List.""

Candidates will be added weekly. But we'll also be filtering out everyone who lands a job so companies can focus on those actively looking.

We could use your help spreading the word (again).

Feel free to like and share this with your network if you think it could be helpful to anyone. 

We got this.

I get asked this question a lot. Especially, from recruiters who see our new AI powered features we launch on Cutshort.

My answer - AI will actually make your job MORE valuable. How?

Take chatGPT for example. With it, now every recruiter can make a good JD, draft a decent email, send good rejection letters etc. However:

1.  Are these AI generated things saying the things you really want to say?

2. After all the great AI work, when you actually come face to face with candidates, are you able to plugs the trust/information gaps left by AI and build trustworthy relationships with the candidates?

In short, configuring AI to say right things the right way and establishing a human relationship after AI has done its work are two new skills that will make your job more valuable. 

It's not AI that will take our jobs. It will be our inability to upshift.

As someone who was laid-off once, here are my tips:

üëâ Do NOT rush to get hired asap. Think about your interests and strengths and pick the right roles. Getting into a wrong company/job again will make things much worse.

üëâ Don the consultant hat, if possible. Talk to your friends/connects and start adding whatever value you can. It's okay to do it for free. What's more important is to psychologically have work again. (Don't forget to update your LinkedIn profile and resume with a title such as ""Independent Consultant - XYZ"". )

üëâ Don't question your worth. You are NOT your job. Explore your interests and spend time with people you care about. Layoff is not a stigma - it's just an event that might give you more than you have lost. 

Anyone wants to add any other tips?

Founders/operators who coach are highest quality such as Sachin Bhatia from Exotel  Varun Shoor Ashwin Ramasamy Mrigank Tripathi Pallav Nadhani Dhruvil Sanghvi  and so many more. And then there are gurus who never shy away from helping you like Krish Subramanian Avinash Raghava Suresh Sambandam.

Bootstrapping to profitability and then $1M revenue, going from 5 customers to welcoming 1000, we have crossed many business milestones in the last 7 years. 

But what achievement is defining and dear to me? It's building a honest team that loves to learn, perform and boost each other every day.

Yo Cutshort team: This year was a roller coaster ride. You have worked smart, hard and long. You have won some and lost some. But heck, the time we had was well worth every minute. Let's enjoy some time off and create magic again in 2023. ü•Ç

Who do you want to be?  ü§î

All of us have this in our mind, right? A unicorn founder, someone with $10M in bank account, the best sales person, the go-to industry leader on marketing, etc etc.

But did you notice that this focus on ""what we want to be"" often takes us away from ""what we love doing"". 

For e.g. to be become a ""very rich and powerful person"", we might stop doing things we love such as teaching school kids or learning from others. On the flip side, we might start doing things that we don't love - such as attending networking parties and projecting a successful image outside.

Focussing on ""what we want to do"" vs ""who we want to be"" can be a happier and more successful path.
